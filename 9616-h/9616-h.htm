    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sad curlews, annunciators of the autumn, had just appeared in a mass
      in a gray squall, fleeing from the high sea under the threat of
      approaching tempests. At the mouth of the southern rivers, of the Adour,
      of the Nivelle, of the Bidassoa which runs by Spain, they wandered above
      the waters already cold, flying low, skimming, with their wings over the
      mirror-like surfaces. And their cries, at the fall of the October night,
      seemed to ring the annual half-death of the exhausted plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Pyrenean lands, all bushes and vast woods, the melancholy of the
      rainy nights of declining seasons fell slowly, enveloping like a shroud,
      while Ramuntcho walked on the moss-covered path, without noise, shod with
      rope soles, supple and silent in his mountaineer's tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho was coming on foot from a very long distance, ascending the
      regions neighboring the Bay of Biscay, toward his isolated house which
      stood above, in a great deal of shade, near the Spanish frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the solitary passer-by, who went up so quickly without trouble and
      whose march in sandals was not heard, distances more and more profound
      deepened on all sides, blended in twilight and mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The autumn, the autumn marked itself everywhere. The corn, herb of the
      lowlands, so magnificently green in the Spring, displayed shades of dead
      straw in the depths of the valleys, and, on all the summits, beeches and
      oaks shed their leaves. The air was almost cold; an odorous humidity came
      out of the mossy earth and, at times, there came from above a light
      shower. One felt it near and anguishing, that season of clouds and of long
      rains, which returns every time with the same air of bringing the
      definitive exhaustion of saps and irremediable death,&mdash;but which
      passes like all things and which one forgets at the following spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everywhere, in the wet of the leaves strewing the earth, in the wet of the
      herbs long and bent, there was a sadness of death, a dumb resignation to
      fecund decomposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the autumn, when it comes to put an end to the plants, brings only a
      sort of far-off warning to man, a little more durable, who resists several
      winters and lets himself be lured several times by the charm of spring.
      Man, in the rainy nights of October and of November, feels especially the
      instinctive desire to seek shelter at home, to warm himself at the hearth,
      under the roof which so many thousand years amassed have taught him
      progressively to build.&mdash;And Ramuntcho felt awakening in the depths
      of his being the old ancestral aspirations for the Basque home of the
      country, the isolated home, unattached to the neighboring homes. He
      hastened his steps the more toward the primitive dwelling where his mother
      was waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there, one perceived them in the distance, indistinct in the
      twilight, the Basque houses, very distant from one another, dots white or
      grayish, now in the depth of some gorge steeped in darkness, then on some
      ledge of the mountains with summits lost in the obscure sky. Almost
      inconsequential are these human habitations, in the immense and confused
      entirety of things; inconsequential and even annihilated quite, at this
      hour, before the majesty of the solitude and of the eternal forest nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho ascended rapidly, lithe, bold and young, still a child, likely
      to play on his road as little mountaineers play, with a rock, a reed, or a
      twig that one whittles while walking. The air was growing sharper, the
      environment harsher, and already he ceased to hear the cries of the
      curlews, their rusty-pulley cries, on the rivers beneath. But Ramuntcho
      was singing one of those plaintive songs of the olden time, which are
      still transmitted in the depths of the distant lands, and his naive voice
      went through the mist or the rain, among the wet branches of the oaks,
      under the grand shroud, more and more sombre, of isolation, of autumn and
      of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped for an instant, pensive, to see a cart drawn by oxen pass at a
      great distance above him. The cowboy who drove the slow team sang also;
      through a bad and rocky path, they descended into a ravine bathed in
      shadows already nocturnal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And soon they disappeared in a turn of the path, masked suddenly by trees,
      as if they had vanished in an abyss. Then Ramuntcho felt the grasp of an
      unexpected melancholy, unexplained like most of his complex impressions,
      and, with an habitual gesture, while he resumed his less alert march, he
      brought down like a visor on his gray eyes, very sharp and very soft, the
      crown of his woolen Basque cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why?&mdash;What had to do with him this cart, this singing cowboy whom he
      did not even know? Evidently nothing&mdash;and yet, for having seen them
      disappear into a lodging, as they did doubtless every night, into some
      farm isolated in a lowland, a more exact realization had come to him of
      the humble life of the peasant, attached to the soil and to the native
      field, of those human lives as destitute of joy as beasts of burden, but
      with declines more prolonged and more lamentable. And, at the same time,
      through his mind had passed the intuitive anxiety for other places, for
      the thousand other things that one may see or do in this world and which
      one may enjoy; a chaos of troubling half thoughts, of atavic reminiscences
      and of phantoms had furtively marked themselves in the depths of his
      savage child's mind&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      For Ramuntcho was a mixture of two races very different and of two beings
      separated, if one may say it, by an abyss of several generations. Created
      by the sad fantasy of one of the refined personages of our dazzled epoch,
      he had been inscribed at his birth as the &ldquo;son of an unknown father&rdquo; and
      he bore no other name than that of his mother. So, he did not feel that he
      was quite similar to his companions in games and healthy fatigues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent for a moment, he walked less quickly toward his house, on the
      deserted paths winding on the heights. In him, the chaos of other things,
      of the luminous &ldquo;other places&rdquo;, of the splendors or of the terrors foreign
      to his own life, agitated itself confusedly, trying to disentangle itself&mdash;But
      no, all this, being indistinct and incomprehensible, remained formless in
      the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, thinking no more of it, he began to sing his song again. The song
      told, in monotonous couplets, the complaint of a linen weaver whose lover
      in a distant war prolonged his absence. It was written in that mysterious
      Euskarian language, the age of which seems incalculable and the origin of
      which remains unknown. And little by little, under the influence of the
      ancient melody, of the wind and of the solitude, Ramuntcho found himself
      as he was at the beginning of his walk, a simple Basque mountaineer,
      sixteen or seventeen years old, formed like a man, but retaining the
      ignorance and the candor of a little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon he perceived Etchezar, his parish, its belfry massive as the dungeon
      of a fortress; near the church, some houses were grouped; others, more
      numerous, had preferred to be disseminated in the surroundings, among
      trees, in ravines or on bluffs. The night fell entirely, hastily that
      evening, because of the sombre veils hooked to the great summits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around this village, above or in the valleys, the Basque country appeared,
      at that moment, like a confusion of gigantic, obscure masses. Long mists
      disarranged the perspectives; all the distances, all the depths had become
      inappreciable, the changing mountains seemed to have grown taller in the
      nebulous phantasmagoria of night. The hour, one knew not why, became
      strangely solemn, as if the shade of past centuries was to come out of the
      soil. On the vast lifting-up which is called the Pyrenees, one felt
      something soaring which was, perhaps, the finishing mind of that race, the
      fragments of which have been preserved and to which Ramuntcho belonged by
      his mother&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the child, composed of two essences so diverse, who was walking alone
      toward his dwelling, through the night and the rain, began again in the
      depth of his double being to feel the anxiety of inexplicable
      reminiscences.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he arrived in front of his house,&mdash;which was very elevated,
      in the Basque fashion, with old wooden balconies under narrow windows, the
      glass of which threw into the night the light of a lamp. As he came near
      the entrance, the light noise of his walk became feebler in the thickness
      of the dead leaves: the leaves of those plane-trees shaped like vaults
      which, according to the usage of the land, form a sort of atrium before
      each dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recognized from afar the steps of her son, the serious Franchita, pale
      and straight in her black clothes,&mdash;the one who formerly had loved
      and followed the stranger; then, who, feeling her desertion approaching,
      had returned courageously to the village in order to inhabit alone the
      dilapidated house of her deceased parents. Rather than to live in the vast
      city, and to be troublesome and a solicitor there, she had quickly
      resolved to depart, to renounce everything, to make a simple Basque
      peasant of that little Ramuntcho, who, at his entrance in life, had worn
      gowns embroidered in white silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fifteen years ago, fifteen years, when she returned, clandestinely,
      at a fall of night similar to this one. In the first days of this return,
      dumb and haughty to her former companions from fear of their disdain, she
      would go out only to go to church, her black cloth mantilla lowered on her
      eyes. Then, at length, when curiosity was appeased, she had returned to
      her habits, so valiantly and so irreproachably that all had forgiven her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To greet and embrace her son she smiled with joy and tenderness, but,
      silent by nature and reserved as both were, they said to each other only
      what it was useful to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat at his accustomed place to eat the soup and the smoking dish which
      she served to him without speaking. The room, carefully kalsomined, was
      made gay by the sudden light of a flame of branches in the tall and wide
      chimney ornamented with a festoon of white calico. In frames, hooked in
      good order, there were images of Ramuntcho's first communion and different
      figures of saints with Basque legends; then the Virgin of Pilar, the
      Virgin of Anguish, and rosaries, and blessed palms. The kitchen utensils
      shone, in a line on shelves sealed to the walls; every shelf ornamented
      with one of those pink paper frills, cut in designs, which are
      manufactured in Spain and on which are printed, invariably, series of
      personages dancing with castanets, or scenes in the lives of the
      toreadors. In this white interior, before this joyful and clear chimney,
      one felt an impression of home, a tranquil welfare, which was augmented by
      the notion of the vast, wet, surrounding night, of the grand darkness of
      the valleys, of the mountains and of the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franchita, as every evening, looked long at her son, looked at him
      embellishing and growing, taking more and more an air of decision and of
      force, as his brown mustache was more and more marked above his fresh
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had supped, eaten with his young mountaineer's appetite several
      slices of bread and drunk two glasses of cider, he rose, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to sleep, for we have to work tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the mother, &ldquo;and when are you to get up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At one o'clock, as soon as the moon sets. They will whistle under the
      window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bundles of silk and bundles of velvet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same as usual: Arrochkoa, Florentino and the Iragola brothers. It is,
      as it was the other night, for Itchoua, with whom I have just made an
      engagement. Good-night, mother&mdash;Oh, we shall not be out late and,
      sure, I will be back before mass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, Franchita leaned her head on the solid shoulder of her son, in a
      coaxing humor almost infantile, different suddenly from her habitual
      manner, and, her cheek against his, she remained tenderly leaning, as if
      to say in a confident abandonment of her will: &ldquo;I am still troubled a
      little by those night undertakings; but, when I reflect, what you wish is
      always well; I am dependent on you, and you are everything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the shoulder of the stranger, formerly, it was her custom to lean and
      to abandon herself thus, in the time when she loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ramuntcho had gone to his little room, she stayed thinking for a
      longer time than usual before resuming her needlework. So, it became
      decidedly his trade, this night work in which one risks receiving the
      bullets of Spain's carbineers!&mdash;He had begun for amusement, in
      bravado, like most of them, and as his friend Arrochkoa was beginning, in
      the same band as he; then, little by little, he had made a necessity of
      this continual adventure in dark nights; he deserted more and more, for
      this rude trade, the open air workshop of the carpenter where she had
      placed him as an apprentice to carve beams out of oak trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was what he would be in life, her little Ramuntcho, so coddled
      formerly in his white gown and for whom she had formed naively so many
      dreams: a smuggler! Smuggler and pelota player,&mdash;two things which go
      well together and which are essentially Basque.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated still, however, to let him follow that unexpected vocation.
      Not in disdain for smugglers, oh, no, for her father had been a smuggler;
      her two brothers also; the elder killed by a Spanish bullet in the
      forehead, one night that he was swimming across the Bidassoa, the second a
      refugee in America to escape the Bayonne prison; both respected for their
      audacity and their strength. No, but he, Ramuntcho, the son of the
      stranger, he, doubtless, might have had pretensions to lead a less harsh
      life than these men if, in a hasty and savage moment, she had not
      separated him from his father and brought him back to the Basque
      mountains. In truth, he was not heartless, Ramuntcho's father; when,
      fatally, he had wearied of her, he had made some efforts not to let her
      see it and never would he have abandoned her with her child if, in her
      pride, she had not quitted him. Perhaps it would be her duty to-day to
      write to him, to ask him to think of his son&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the image of Gracieuse presented itself naturally to her mind, as
      it did every time she thought of Ramuntcho's future. She was the little
      betrothed whom she had been wishing for him for ten years. (In the
      sections of country unacquainted with modern fashions, it is usual to
      marry when very young and often to know and select one another for husband
      and wife in the first years of life.) A little girl with hair fluffed in a
      gold mist, daughter of a friend of her childhood, of a certain Dolores
      Detcharry, who had been always conceited&mdash;and who had remained
      contemptuous since the epoch of the great fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, the father's intervention in the future of Ramuntcho would have
      a decisive influence in obtaining the hand of that girl&mdash;and would
      permit even of asking it of Dolores with haughtiness, after the ancient
      quarrel. But Franchita felt a great uneasiness in her, increasing as the
      thought of addressing herself to that man became more precise. And then,
      she recalled the look, so often sombre, of the stranger, she recalled his
      vague words of infinite lassitude, of incomprehensible despair; he had the
      air of seeing always, beyond her horizon, distant abysses and darkness,
      and, although he was not an insulter of sacred things, never would he
      pray, thus giving to her this excess of remorse, of having allied herself
      to some pagan to whom heaven would be closed forever. His friends were
      similar to him, refined also, faithless, prayerless, exchanging among
      themselves in frivolous words abysmal thoughts.&mdash;Oh, if Ramuntcho by
      contact with them were to become similar to them all!&mdash;desert the
      churches, fly from the sacraments and the mass!&mdash;Then, she remembered
      the letters of her old father,&mdash;now decomposed in the profound earth,
      under a slab of granite, near the foundations of his parish church&mdash;those
      letters in Euskarian tongue which he wrote to her, after the first months
      of indignation and of silence, in the city where she had dragged her
      fault. &ldquo;At least, my poor Franchita, my daughter, are you in a country
      where the men are pious and go to church regularly?&mdash;&rdquo; Oh! no, they
      were hardly pious, the men of the great city, not more the fashionable
      ones who were in the society of Ramuntcho's father than the humblest
      laborers in the suburban district where she lived hidden; all carried away
      by the same current far from the hereditary dogmas, far from the antique
      symbols.&mdash;And Ramuntcho, in such surroundings, how would he resist?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Other reasons, less important perhaps, retained her also. Her haughty
      dignity, which in that city had maintained her honest and solitary,
      revolted truly at the idea that she would have to reappear as a solicitor
      before her former lover. Then, her superior commonsense, which nothing had
      ever been able to lead astray or to dazzle, told her that it was too late
      now to change anything; that Ramuntcho, until now ignorant and free, would
      not know how to attain the dangerous regions where the intelligence of his
      father had elevated itself, but that he would languish at the bottom, like
      one outclassed. And, in fine, a sentiment which she hardly confessed to
      herself, lingered powerfully in the depths of her heart: the fear of
      losing her son, of guiding him no longer, of holding him no longer, of
      having him no longer.&mdash;And so, in that instant of decisive
      reflection, after having hesitated for years, she inclined more and more
      to remain stubborn in her silence with regard to the stranger and to let
      pass humbly near her the life of her Ramuntcho, under the protecting looks
      of the Virgin and the saints.&mdash;There remained unsolved the question
      of Gracieuse Detcharry.&mdash;Well, she would marry, in spite of
      everything, her son, smuggler and poor though he be! With her instinct of
      a mother somewhat savagely loving, she divined that the little girl was
      enamoured enough not to fall out of love ever; she had seen this in her
      fifteen year old black eyes, obstinate and grave under the golden nimbus
      of her hair. Gracieuse marrying Ramuntcho for his charm alone, in spite of
      and against maternal will!&mdash;The rancor and vindictiveness that lurked
      in the mind of Franchita rejoiced suddenly at that great triumph over the
      pride of Dolores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the isolated house where, under the grand silence of midnight, she
      decided alone her son's future, the spirit of the Basque ancestors passed,
      sombre and jealous also, disdainful of the stranger, fearful of impiety,
      of changes, of evolutions of races;&mdash;the spirit of the Basque
      ancestors, the old immutable spirit which still maintains that people with
      eyes turned toward the anterior ages; the mysterious antique spirit by
      which the children are led to act as before them their fathers had acted,
      at the side of the same mountains, in the same villages, around the same
      belfries.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of steps now, in the dark, outside!&mdash;Someone walking softly
      in sandals on the thickness of the plane-tree leaves strewing the soil.&mdash;Then,
      a whistled appeal.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      What, already!&mdash;Already one o'clock in the morning&mdash;!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Quite resolved now, she opened the door to the chief smuggler with a
smile of greeting that the latter had never seen in her:

 &ldquo;Come in, Itchoua,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;warm yourself&mdash;while I go wake up my
son.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A tall and large man, that Itchoua, thin, with a thick chest, clean shaven
      like a priest, in accordance with the fashion of the old time Basque;
      under the cap which he never took off, a colorless face, inexpressive, cut
      as with a pruning hook, and recalling the beardless personages archaically
      drawn on the missals of the fifteenth century. Above his hollow cheeks,
      the breadth of the jaws, the jutting out of the muscles of the neck gave
      the idea of his extreme force. He was of the Basque type, excessively
      accentuated; eyes caved-in too much under the frontal arcade; eyebrows of
      rare length, the points of which, lowered as on the figures of tearful
      madonnas, almost touched the hair at the temples. Between thirty and fifty
      years, it was impossible to assign an age to him. His name was Jose-Maria
      Gorosteguy; but, according to the custom he was known in the country by
      the surname of Itchoua (the Blind) given to him in jest formerly, because
      of his piercing sight which plunged in the night like that of cats. He was
      a practising Christian, a church warden of his parish and a chorister with
      a thundering voice. He was famous also for his power of resistance to
      fatigue, being capable of climbing the Pyrenean slopes for hours at racing
      speed with heavy loads on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho came down soon, rubbing his eyelids, still heavy from a youthful
      sleep, and, at his aspect, the gloomy visage of Itchoua was illuminated by
      a smile. A continual seeker for energetic and strong boys that he might
      enroll in his band, and knowing how to keep them in spite of small wages,
      by a sort of special point of honor, he was an expert in legs and in
      shoulders as well as in temperaments, and he thought a great deal of his
      new recruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franchita, before she would let them go, leaned her head again on her
      son's neck; then she escorted the two men to the threshold of her door,
      opened on the immense darkness,&mdash;and recited piously the Pater for
      them, while they went into the dark night, into the rain, into the chaos
      of the mountains, toward the obscure frontier.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Several hours later, at the first uncertain flush of dawn, at the instant
      when shepherds and fisherman awake, they were returning joyously, the
      smugglers, having finished their undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having started on foot and gone, with infinite precautions to be silent,
      through ravines, through woods, through fords of rivers, they were
      returning, as if they were people who had never anything to conceal from
      anybody, in a bark of Fontarabia, hired under the eyes of Spain's custom
      house officers, through the Bidassoa river.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the mass of mountains and of clouds, all the sombre chaos of the
      preceding night had disentangled itself almost suddenly, as under the
      touch of a magic wand. The Pyrenees, returned to their real proportions,
      were only average mountains, with slopes bathed in a shadow still
      nocturnal, but with peaks neatly cut in a sky which was already clearing.
      The air had become lukewarm, suave, exquisite, as if the climate or the
      season had suddenly changed,&mdash;and it was the southern wind which was
      beginning to blow, the delicious southern wind special to the Basque
      country, which chases before it, the cold, the clouds and the mists, which
      enlivens the shades of all things, makes the sky blue, prolongs the
      horizons infinitely and gives, even in winter, summer illusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boatman who was bringing the smugglers back to France pushed the
      bottom of the river with his long pole, and the bark dragged, half
      stranded. At this moment, that Bidassoa by which the two countries are
      separated, seemed drained, and its antique bed, excessively large, had the
      flat extent of a small desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was decidedly breaking, tranquil and slightly pink. It was the
      first of the month of November; on the Spanish shore, very distant, in a
      monastery, an early morning bell rang clear, announcing the religious
      solemnity of every autumn. And Ramuntcho, comfortably seated in the bark,
      softly cradled and rested after the fatigues of the night, breathed the
      new breeze with well-being in all his senses. With a childish joy, he saw
      the assurance of a radiant weather for that All-Saints' Day which was to
      bring to him all that he knew of this world's festivals: the chanted high
      mass, the game of pelota before the assembled village, then, at last, the
      dance of the evening with Gracieuse, the fandango in the moon-light on the
      church square.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lost, little by little, the consciousness of his physical life,
      Ramuntcho, after his sleepless night; a sort of torpor, benevolent under
      the breath of the virgin morning, benumbed his youthful body, leaving his
      mind in a dream. He knew well such impressions and sensations, for the
      return at the break of dawn, in the security of a bark where one sleeps,
      is the habitual sequel of a smuggler's expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the details of the Bidassoa's estuary were familiar to him, all
      its aspects, which changed with the hour, with the monotonous and regular
      tide.&mdash;Twice every day the sea wave comes to this flat bed; then,
      between France and Spain there is a lake, a charming little sea with
      diminutive blue waves&mdash;and the barks float, the barks go quickly; the
      boatmen sing their old time songs, which the grinding and the shocks of
      the cadenced oars accompany. But when the waters have withdrawn, as at
      this moment, there remains between the two countries only a sort of
      lowland, uncertain and of changing color, where walk men with bare legs,
      where barks drag themselves, creeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now in the middle of this lowland, Ramuntcho and his band, half
      dozing under the dawning light. The colors of things began to appear, out
      of the gray of night. They glided, they advanced by slight jerks, now
      through yellow velvet which was sand, then through a brown thing, striped
      regularly and dangerous to walkers, which was slime. And thousands of
      little puddles, left by the tide of the day before, reflected the dawn,
      shone on the soft extent like mother-of-pearl shells. On the little yellow
      and brown desert, their boatman followed the course of a thin, silver
      stream, which represented the Bidassoa at low tide. From time to time,
      some fisherman crossed their path, passed near them in silence, without
      singing as the custom is in rowing, too busy poling, standing in his bark
      and working his pole with beautiful plastic gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were day-dreaming, they approached the French shore, the
      smugglers. On the other side of the strange zone which they were
      traversing as in a sled, that silhouette of an old city, which fled from
      them slowly, was Fontarabia; those highlands which rose to the sky with
      figures so harsh, were the Spanish Pyrenees. All this was Spain,
      mountainous Spain, eternally standing there in the face of them and
      incessantly preoccupying their minds: a country which one must reach in
      silence, in dark nights, in nights without moonlight, under the rain of
      winter; a country which is the perpetual aim of dangerous expeditions; a
      country which, for the men of Ramuntcho's village, seems always to close
      the southwestern horizon, while it changes in appearance according to the
      clouds and the hours; a country which is the first to be lighted by the
      pale sun of mornings and which masks afterward, like a sombre screen the
      red sun of evenings.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He adored his Basque land, Ramuntcho,&mdash;and this morning was one of
      the times when this adoration penetrated him more profoundly. In his after
      life, during his exile, the reminiscence of these delightful returns at
      dawn, after the nights of smuggling, caused in him an indescribable and
      very anguishing nostalgia. But his love for the hereditary soil was not as
      simple as that of his companions. As in all his sentiments, as in all his
      sensations, there were mingled in it diverse elements. At first the
      instinctive and unanalyzed attachment of his maternal ancestors to the
      native soil, then something more refined coming from his father, an
      unconscious reflection of the artistic admiration which had retained the
      stranger here for several seasons and had given to him the caprice of
      allying himself with a girl of these mountains in order to obtain a Basque
      descendance.&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is eleven o'clock now, and the bells of France and Spain mingle above
      the frontier their religious festival vibrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bathed, rested, and in Sunday dress, Ramuntcho was going with his mother
      to the high mass of All-Saints' Day. On the path, strewn with reddish
      leaves, they descended toward their parish, under a warm sun which gave to
      them the illusion of summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, dressed in a manner almost elegant and like a city denizen, save for
      the traditional Basque cap, which he wore on the side and pulled down like
      a visor over his childish eyes. She, straight and proud, her head high,
      her demeanor distinguished, in a gown of new form; having the air of a
      society woman, except for the mantilla; made of black cloth, which covered
      her hair and her shoulders. In the great city formerly she had learned how
      to dress&mdash;and anyway, in the Basque country, where so many ancient
      traditions have been preserved, the women and the girls of the least
      important villages have all taken the habit of dressing in the fashion of
      the day, with an elegance unknown to the peasants of the other French
      provinces.
    </p>
    <p>
      They separated, as etiquette ordains, in the yard of the church, where the
      immense cypress trees smelled of the south and the Orient. It resembled a
      mosque from the exterior, their parish, with its tall, old, ferocious
      walls, pierced at the top only by diminutive windows, with its warm color
      of antiquity, of dust and of sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Franchita entered by one of the lower doors, Ramuntcho went up a
      venerable stone stairway which led one from the exterior wall to the high
      tribunes reserved for men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extremity of the sombre church was of dazzling old gold, with a
      profusion of twisted columns, of complicated entablements, of statues with
      excessive convolutions and with draperies in the style of the Spanish
      Renaissance. And this magnificence of the tabernacle was in contrast with
      the simplicity of the lateral walls, simply kalsomined. But an air of
      extreme old age harmonized these things, which one felt were accustomed
      for centuries to endure in the face of one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early still, and people were hardly arriving for this high mass.
      Leaning on the railing of his tribune, Ramuntcho looked at the women
      entering, all like black phantoms, their heads and dress concealed under
      the mourning cashmere which it is usual to wear at church. Silent and
      collected, they glided on the funereal pavement of mortuary slabs, where
      one could read still, in spite of the effacing of ages, inscriptions in
      Euskarian tongue, names of extinguished families and dates of past
      centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracieuse, whose coming preoccupied Ramuntcho, was late. But, to distract
      his mind for a moment, a &ldquo;convoy&rdquo; advanced slowly; a convoy, that is a
      parade of parents and nearest neighbors of one who had died during the
      week, the men still draped in the long cape which is worn at funerals, the
      women under the mantle and the traditional hood of full mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above, in the two immense tribunes superposed along the sides of the nave,
      the men came one by one to take their places, grave and with rosaries in
      their hands: farmers, laborers, cowboys, poachers or smugglers, all pious
      and ready to kneel when the sacred bell rang. Each one of them, before
      taking his seat, hooked behind him, to a nail on the wall, his woolen cap,
      and little by little, on the white background of the kalsomine, came into
      line rows of innumerable Basque headgear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below, the little girls of the school entered at last, in good order,
      escorted by the Sisters of Saint Mary of the Rosary. And, among these
      nuns, wrapped in black, Ramuntcho recognized Gracieuse. She, too, had her
      head enveloped with black; her blonde hair, which to-night would be
      flurried in the breeze of the fandango, was hidden for the moment under
      the austere mantilla of the ceremony. Gracieuse had not been a scholar for
      two years, but was none the less the intimate friend of the sisters, her
      teachers, ever in their company for songs, novenas, or decorations of
      white flowers around the statues of the Holy Virgin.&mdash;Then, the
      priests, in their most sumptuous costumes, appeared in front of the
      magnificent gold of the tabernacle, on a platform elevated and theatrical,
      and the mass began, celebrated, in this distant village, with excessive
      pomp as in a great city. There were choirs of small boys chanting in
      infantile voices with a savage ardor. Then choruses of little girls, whom
      a sister accompanied at the harmonium and which the clear and fresh voice
      of Gracieuse guided. From time to time a clamor came, like a storm, from
      the tribunes above where the men were, a formidable response animated the
      old vaults, the old sonorous wainscoting, which for centuries have
      vibrated with the same song.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      To do the same things which for numberless ages the ancestors have done
      and to tell blindly the same words of faith, are indications of supreme
      wisdom, are a supreme force. For all the faithful who sang there came from
      this immutable ceremony of the mass a sort of peace, a confused but soft
      resignation to coming destruction. Living of the present hour, they lost a
      little of their ephemeral personality to attach themselves better to the
      dead lying under the slabs and to continue them more exactly, to form with
      them and their future descendants only one of these resisting entireties,
      of almost infinite duration, which is called a race.

      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ite missa est!&rdquo; The high mass is finished and the antique church is
      emptying. Outside, in the yard, among the tombs, the assistants scatter.
      And all the joy of a sunny noon greets them, as they come out of the
      sombre nave where each, according to his naive faculties, had caught more
      or less a glimpse of the great mystery and of the inevitable death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearing all the uniform national cap, the men come down the exterior
      stairway; the women, slower to be captivated by the lure of the blue sky,
      retaining still under the mourning veil a little of the dream of the
      church, come out of the lower porticoes in black troops; around a grave
      freshly closed, some stop and weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The southern wind, which is the great magician of the Basque country,
      blows softly. The autumn of yesterday has gone and it is forgotten.
      Lukewarm breaths pass through the air, vivifying, healthier than those of
      May, having the odor of hay and the odor of flowers. Two singers of the
      highway are there, leaning on the graveyard wall, and they intone, with a
      tambourine and a guitar, an old seguidilla of Spain, bringing here the
      warm and somewhat Arabic gaieties of the lands beyond the frontiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the midst of all this intoxication of the southern November, more
      delicious in this country than the intoxication of the spring, Ramuntcho,
      having come down one of the first, watches the coming out of the sisters
      in order to greet Gracieuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sandal peddler has come also to this closing of the mass, and displays
      among the roses of the tombs his linen foot coverings ornamented with
      woolen flowers. Young men, attracted by the dazzling embroideries, gather
      around him to select colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bees and the flies buzz as in June; the country has become again, for
      a few hours, for a few days, for as long as this wind will blow, luminous
      and warm. In front of the mountains, which have assumed violent brown or
      sombre green tints, and which seem to have advanced to-day until they
      overhang the church, houses of the village appear in relief, very neat,
      very white under their coat of kalsomine,&mdash;old Pyrenean houses with
      their wooden balconies and on their walls intercrossings of beams in the
      fashion of the olden time. In the southwest, the visible portion of Spain,
      the denuded and red peak familiar to smugglers, stands straight and near
      in the beautiful clear sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracieuse does not appear yet, retarded doubtless by the nuns in some
      altar service. As for Franchita, who never mingles in the Sunday
      festivals, she takes the path to her house, silent and haughty, after a
      smile to her son, whom she will not see again until to-night after the
      dances have come to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of young men, among whom is the vicar who has just taken off his
      golden ornaments, forms itself at the threshold of the church, in the sun,
      and seems to be plotting grave projects.&mdash;They are the great players
      of the country, the fine flower of the lithe and the strong; it is for the
      pelota game of the afternoon that they are consulting, and they make a
      sign to Ramuntcho who pensively comes to them. Several old men come also
      and surround them, caps crushed on white hair and faces clean shaven like
      those of monks: champions of the olden time, still proud of their former
      successes, and sure that their counsel shall be respected in the national
      game, which the men here attend with pride as on a field of honor.&mdash;After
      a courteous discussion, the game is arranged; it will be immediately after
      vespers; they will play the &ldquo;blaid&rdquo; with the wicker glove, and the six
      selected champions, divided into two camps, shall be the vicar, Ramuntcho
      and Arrochkoa, Gracieuse's brother, against three famous men of the
      neighboring villages: Joachim of Mendiazpi; Florentino of Espelette, and
      Irrubeta of Hasparren&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now comes the &ldquo;convoy&rdquo;, which comes out of the church and passes by them,
      so black in this feast of light, and so archaic, with the envelope of its
      capes, of its caps and of its veils. They are expressive of the Middle
      Age, these people, while they pass in a file, the Middle Age whose shadow
      the Basque country retains. And they express, above all, death, as the
      large funereal slabs, with which the nave is paved, express it, as the
      cypress trees and the tombs express it, and all the things in this place,
      where the men come to pray, express it: death, always death.&mdash;But a
      death very softly neighboring life, under the shield of the old consoling
      symbols&mdash;for life is there marked also, almost equally sovereign, in
      the warm rays which light up the cemetery, in the eyes of the children who
      play among the roses of autumn, in the smile of those beautiful brown
      girls who, the mass being finished, return with steps indolently supple
      toward the village; in the muscles of all this youthfulness of men, alert
      and vigorous, who shall soon exercise at the ball-game their iron legs and
      arms.&mdash;And of this group of old men and of boys at the threshold of a
      church, of this mingling, so peacefully harmonious, of death and of life,
      comes the benevolent lesson, the teaching that one must enjoy in time
      strength and love; then, without obstinacy in enduring, submit to the
      universal law of passing and dying, repeating with confidence, like these
      simple-minded and wise men, the same prayers by which the agonies of the
      ancestors were cradled.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is improbably radiant, the sun of noon in this yard of the dead. The
      air is exquisite and one becomes intoxicated by breathing it. The Pyrenean
      horizons have been swept of their clouds, their least vapors, and it seems
      as if the wind of the south had brought here the limpidities of Andalusia
      or of Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Basque guitar and tambourine accompany the sung seguilla, which the
      beggars of Spain throw, like a slight irony into this lukewarm breeze,
      above the dead. And boys and girls think of the fandango of to-night, feel
      ascending in them the desire and the intoxication of dancing.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last here come the sisters, so long expected by Ramuntcho; with them
      advance Gracieuse and her mother, Dolores, who is still in widow's weeds,
      her face invisible under a black cape closed by a crape veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      What can this Dolores be plotting with the Mother Superior?&mdash;Ramuntcho,
      knowing that these two women are enemies, is astonished and disquiet
      to-day to see them walk side by side. Now they even stop to talk aside, so
      important and secret doubtless is what they are saying; their similar
      black caps, overhanging like wagon-hoods, touch each other and they talk
      sheltered under them; a whispering of phantoms, one would say, under a
      sort of little black vault.&mdash;And Ramuntcho has the sentiment of
      something hostile plotted against him under these two wicked caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the colloquy comes to an end, he advances, touches his cap for a
      salute, awkward and timid suddenly in presence of this Dolores, whose
      harsh look under the veil he divines. This woman is the only person in the
      world who has the power to chill him, and, never elsewhere than in her
      presence, he feels weighing upon him the blemish of being the child of an
      unknown father, of wearing no other name than that of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, however, to his great surprise, she is more cordial than usual,
      and she says with a voice almost amiable: &ldquo;Good-morning, my boy!&rdquo; Then he
      goes to Gracieuse, to ask her with a brusque anxiety: &ldquo;To-night, at eight
      o'clock, say if you will be on the square to dance with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some time, every Sunday had brought to him the same fear of being
      deprived of dancing with her in the evening. In the week he hardly ever
      saw her. Now that he was becoming a man, the only occasion for him to have
      her company was this ball on the green of the square, in the light of the
      stars or of the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had fallen in love with each other five years ago, Ramuntcho and
      Gracieuse, when they were still children. And such loves, when by chance
      the awakening of the senses confirms instead of destroying them, become in
      young heads something sovereign and exclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had never thought of saying this to each other, they knew it so well;
      never had they talked together of the future which did not appear possible
      to one without the other. And the isolation of this mountain village where
      they lived, perhaps also the hostility of Dolores to their naive,
      unexpressed projects, brought them more closely together&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, at eight o'clock, say if you will be on the square to dance
      with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rdquo; replies the little girl, fixing on her friend eyes of
      sadness, a little frightened, as well as of ardent tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure?&rdquo; asked Ramuntcho again, whom these eyes make anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, he is quieted again this time, knowing that if Gracieuse has said and
      decided something one may count on it. And at once the weather seems to
      him more beautiful, the Sunday more amusing, life more charming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner hour calls the Basques now to the houses or to the inns, and,
      under the light, somewhat gloomy, of the noon sun, the village seems
      deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho goes to the cider mill which the smugglers and pelota players
      frequent. There, he sits at a table, his cap still drawn over his eyes,
      with his friends: Arrochkoa, two or three others of the mountains and the
      somber Itchoua, their chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      A festive meal is prepared for them, with fish of the Nivelle, ham and
      hares. In the foreground of the hall, vast and dilapidated, near the
      windows, are the tables, the oak benches on which they are seated; in the
      background, in a penumbra, are the enormous casks filled with new cider.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this band of Ramuntcho, which is there entire, under the piercing eye
      of its chief, reigns an emulation of audacity and a reciprocal, fraternal
      devotion; during their night expeditions especially, they are all one to
      live or to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning heavily, benumbed in the pleasure of resting after the fatigues of
      the night and concentrated in the expectation of satiating their robust
      hunger, they are silent at first, hardly raising their heads to look
      through the window-panes at the passing girls. Two are very young, almost
      children like Ramuntcho: Arrochkoa and Florentino. The others have, like
      Itchoua, hardened faces, eyes in ambuscade under the frontal arcade,
      expressing no certain age; their aspect reveals a past of fatigues, in the
      unreasonable obstinacy to pursue this trade of smuggling, which hardly
      gives bread to the less skilful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, awakened little by little by the smoking dishes, by the sweet cider,
      they talk; soon their words interlace, light, rapid and sonorous, with an
      excessive rolling of the <i>r</i>. They talk in their mysterious language,
      the origin of which is unknown and which seems to the men of the other
      countries in Europe more distant than Mongolian or Sanskrit. They tell
      stories of the night and of the frontier, stratagems newly invented and
      astonishing deceptions of Spanish carbineers. Itchoua, the chief, listens
      more than he talks; one hears only at long intervals his profound voice of
      a church singer vibrate. Arrochkoa, the most elegant of all, is in
      striking contrast with his comrades of the mountain. (His name was Jean
      Detcharry, but he was known only by his surname, which the elders of his
      family transmitted from father to son for centuries.) A smuggler for his
      pleasure, he, without any necessity, and possessing beautiful lands in the
      sunlight; the face fresh and pretty, the blonde mustache turned up in the
      fashion of cats, the eye feline also, the eye caressing and fleeting;
      attracted by all that succeeds, by all that amuses, by all that shines;
      liking Ramuntcho for his triumphs in the ball-game, and quite disposed to
      give to him the hand of his sister, Gracieuse, even if it were only to
      oppose his mother, Dolores. And Florentino, the other great friend of
      Ramuntcho is, on the contrary, the humblest of the band; an athletic,
      reddish fellow, with wide and low forehead, with good eyes of resignation,
      soft as those of beasts of burden; without father or mother, possessing
      nothing in the world except a threadbare costume and three pink cotton
      shirts; unique lover of a little fifteen year old orphan, as poor as he
      and as primitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Itchoua deigns to talk in his turn. He relates, in a tone of
      mystery and of confidence, a certain tale of the time of his youth, in a
      black night, on the Spanish territory, in the gorges of Andarlaza. Seized
      by two carbineers at the turn in a dark path, he had disengaged himself by
      drawing his knife to stab a chest with it: half a second, a resisting
      flesh, then, crack! the blade entering brusquely, a jet of warm blood on
      his hand, the man fallen, and he, fleeing in the obscure rocks&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the voice which says these things with implacable tranquility, is the
      same which for years sings piously every Sunday the liturgy in the old
      sonorous church,&mdash;so much so that it seems to retain a religious and
      almost sacred character&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you are caught&rdquo;&mdash;adds the speaker, scrutinizing them all with
      his eyes, become piercing again&mdash;&ldquo;When you are caught&mdash;What is
      the life of a man worth in such a case? You would not hesitate, either, I
      suppose, if you were caught&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure not,&rdquo; replied Arrochkoa, in a tone of infantile bravado, &ldquo;Sure not!
      In such a case to take the life of a carabinero no one would hesitate!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The debonair Florentino, turned from Itchoua his disapproving eyes.
      Florentino would hesitate; he would not kill. This is divined in the
      expression of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not hesitate,&rdquo; repeated Itchoua, scrutinizing Ramuntcho this
      time in a special manner; &ldquo;you would not hesitate, either, I suppose, if
      you were caught, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; replied Ramuntcho, submissively. &ldquo;Oh, no, surely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his look, like that of Florentino, has turned from Itchoua. A terror
      comes to him of this man, of this imperious and cold influence, so
      completely felt already; an entire soft and refined side of his nature is
      awakened, made disquiet and in revolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence has followed the tale, and Itchoua, discontented with the effect
      of it, proposes a song in order to change the course of ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purely material well-being which comes after dinner, the cider which
      has been drunk, the cigarettes which are lighted and the songs that begin,
      bring back quickly confident joy in these children's heads. And then,
      there are in the band the two brothers Iragola, Marcos and Joachim, young
      men of the mountain above Mendiazpi, who are renowned extemporary speakers
      in the surrounding country and it is a pleasure to hear them, on any
      subject, compose and sing verses which are so pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see,&rdquo; says Itchoua, &ldquo;you, Marcos, are a sailor who wishes to pass
      his life on the ocean and seek fortune in America; you, Joachim, are a
      farm hand who prefers not to quit his village and his soil here. Each of
      you will discuss alternately, in couplets of equal length, the pleasures
      of his trade to the tune&mdash;to the tune of the 'Iru Damacho'. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other, the two brothers, half turned toward each other
      on the oak bench where they sit; an instant of reflection, during which an
      imperceptible agitation of the eyelids alone betrays the working of their
      minds; then, brusquely Marcos, the elder, begins, and they will never
      stop. With their shaven cheeks, their handsome profiles, their chins which
      advance somewhat imperiously above the powerful muscles of the neck, they
      recall, in their grave immobility, the figures engraved on the Roman
      medals. They sing with a certain effort of the throat, like the muezzins
      in the mosques, in high tones. When one has finished his couplet, without
      a second of hesitation or silence, the other begins; more and more their
      minds are animated and inflamed. Around the smugglers' table many other
      caps have gathered and all listen with admiration to the witty or sensible
      things which the two brothers know how to say, ever with the needed
      cadence and rhyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the twentieth stanza, at last, Itchoua interrupts them to make them
      rest and he orders more cider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How have you learned?&rdquo; asked Ramuntcho of the Iragola brothers. &ldquo;How did
      the knack come to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replies Marcos, &ldquo;it is a family trait, as you must know. Our father,
      our grandfather were extemporary composers who were heard with pleasure in
      all the festivals of the Basque country, and our mother also was the
      daughter of a grand improvisator of the village of Lesaca. And then, every
      evening in taking back the oxen or in milking the cows, we practice, or at
      the fireside on winter nights. Yes, every evening, we make compositions in
      this way on subjects which one of us imagines, and it is our greatest
      pleasure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when Florentino's turn to sing comes he, knowing only the old refrains
      of the mountain, intones in an Arabic falsetto voice the complaint of the
      linen weaver; and then Ramuntcho, who had sung it the day before in the
      autumn twilight, sees again the darkened sky of yesterday, the clouds full
      of rain, the cart drawn by oxen going down into a sad and closed valley,
      toward a solitary farm&mdash;and suddenly the unexplained anguish returns
      to him, the one which he had before; the fear of living and of passing
      thus always in these same villages, under the oppression of these same
      mountains; the notion and the confused desire for other places; the
      anxiety for unknown distances&mdash;His eyes, become lifeless and fixed,
      look inwardly; for several strange minutes he feels that he is an exile,
      from what country he does not know, disinherited, of what he does not
      know, sad in the depths of his soul; between him and the men who surround
      him have come suddenly irreducible, hereditary barriers&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Three o'clock. It is the hour when vespers, the last office of the day,
      comes to an end; the hour when leave the church, in a meditation grave as
      that of the morning, all the mantillas of black cloth concealing the
      beautiful hair of the girls and the form of their waists, all the woolen
      caps similarly lowered on the shaven faces of men, on their eyes piercing
      or somber, still plunged in the old time dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the hour when the games are to begin, the dances, the pelota and the
      fandango. All this is traditional and immutable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of the day becomes more golden, one feels the approach of night.
      The church, suddenly empty, forgotten, where persists the odor of incense,
      becomes full of silence, and the old gold of the background shines
      mysteriously in the midst of more shade; silence also is scattered around
      on the tranquil enclosure of the dead, where the folks this time passed
      without stopping, in their haste to go elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the square of the ball-game, people are beginning to arrive from
      everywhere, from the village itself and from the neighboring hamlets, from
      the huts of the shepherds or of the smugglers who perch above, on the
      harsh mountains. Hundreds of Basque caps, all similar, are now reunited,
      ready to judge the players, to applaud or to murmur; they discuss the
      chances, comment upon the relative strength of the players and make big
      bets of money. And young girls, young women gather also, having nothing of
      the awkwardness of the peasants in other provinces of France, elegant,
      refined, graceful in costumes of the new fashions; some wearing on their
      hair the silk kerchief, rolled and arranged like a small cap; others
      bareheaded, their hair dressed in the most modern manner; most of them
      pretty, with admirable eyes and very long eyebrows&mdash;This square,
      always solemn and ordinarily somewhat sad, is filled to-day, Sunday, with
      a lively and gay crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most insignificant hamlet in the Basque country has a square for the
      ball-game, large, carefully kept, in general near the church, under oaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here, this is a central point and something like the Conservatory of
      French ball-players, of those who become celebrated, in South America as
      well as in the Pyrenees, and who, in the great international games, oppose
      the champions of Spain. So the place is particularly beautiful and
      pompous, surprising in so distant a village. It is paved with large
      stones, between which grass grows expressing its antiquity and giving to
      it an air of being abandoned. On the two sides are extended, for the
      spectators, long benches&mdash;made of the red granite of the neighboring
      mountain and, at this moment, all overgrown with autumn scabwort.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the back, the old monumental wall rises, against which the balls
      will strike. It has a rounded front which seems to be the silhouette of a
      dome and bears this inscription, half effaced by time: &ldquo;Blaidka haritzea
      debakatua.&rdquo; (The blaid game is forbidden.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, the day's game is to be the blaid; but the venerable inscription
      dates from the time of the splendor of the national game, degenerated at
      present, as all things degenerate. It had been placed there to preserve
      the tradition of the &ldquo;rebot&rdquo;, a more difficult game, exacting more agility
      and strength, and which has been perpetuated only in the Spanish province
      of Guipuzcoa.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the graded benches are filling up, the paved square, which the grass
      makes green, and which has seen the lithe and the vigorous men of the
      country run since the days of old, remains empty. The beautiful autumn
      sun, at its decline, warms and lights it. Here and there some tall oaks
      shed their leaves above the seated spectators. Beyond are the high church
      and the cypress trees, the entire sacred corner, from which the saints and
      the dead seem to be looking at a distance, protecting the players,
      interested in this game which is the passion still of an entire race and
      characterises it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they enter the arena, the Pelotaris, the six champions among whom
      is one in a cassock: the vicar of the parish. With him are some other
      personages: the crier, who, in an instant, will sing the points; the five
      judges, selected among the experts of different villages to intervene in
      cases of litigation, and some others carrying extra balls and sandals. At
      the right wrist the players attach with thongs a strange wicker thing
      resembling a large, curved fingernail which lengthens the forearm by half.
      It is with this glove (manufactured in France by a unique basket-maker of
      the village of Ascain) that they will have to catch, throw and hurl the
      pelota,&mdash;a small ball of tightened cord covered with sheepskin, which
      is as hard as a wooden ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they try the balls, selecting the best, limbering, with a few points
      that do not count, their athletic arms. Then, they take off their
      waistcoats and carry them to preferred spectators; Ramuntcho gives his to
      Gracieuse, seated in the first row on the lower bench. And all, except the
      priest, who will play in his black gown, are in battle array, their chests
      at liberty in pink cotton shirts or light thread fleshings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistants know them well, these players; in a moment, they shall be
      excited for or against them and will shout at them, frantically, as it
      happens with the toreadors.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the village is entirely animated by the spirit of the olden
      time; in its expectation of the pleasure, in its liveliness, in its ardor,
      it is intensely Basque and very old,&mdash;under the great shade of the
      Gizune, the overhanging mountain, which throws over it a twilight charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the game begins in the melancholy evening. The ball, thrown with much
      strength, flies, strikes the wall in great, quick blows, then rebounds,
      and traverses the air with the rapidity of a bullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wall in the background, rounded like a dome's festoon on the sky, has
      become little by little crowned with heads of children,&mdash;little
      Basques, little cats, ball-players of the future, who soon will
      precipitate themselves like a flight of birds, to pick up the ball every
      time when, thrown too high, it will go beyond the square and fall in the
      fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game becomes gradually warmer as arms and legs are limbered, in an
      intoxication of movement and swiftness. Already Ramuntcho is acclaimed.
      And the vicar also shall be one of the fine players of the day, strange to
      look upon with his leaps similar to those of a cat, and his athletic
      gestures, imprisoned in his priest's gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the rule of the game: when one of the champions of the two camps
      lets the ball fall, it is a point earned by the adverse camp,&mdash;and
      ordinarily the limit is sixty points. After each point, the titled crier
      chants with a full voice in his old time tongue: &ldquo;The but has so much, the
      refil has so much, gentlemen!&rdquo; (The but is the camp which played first,
      the refil is the camp opposed to the but.) And the crier's long clamor
      drags itself above the noise of the crowd, which approves or murmurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the square, the zone gilt and reddened by the sun diminishes, goes,
      devoured by the shade; more and more the great screen of the Gizune
      predominates over everything, seems to enclose in this little corner of
      the world at its feet, the very special life and the ardor of these
      mountaineers&mdash;who are the fragments of a people very mysteriously
      unique, without analogy among nations&mdash;The shade of night marches
      forward and invades in silence, soon it will be sovereign; in the distance
      only a few summits still lighted above so many darkened valleys, are of a
      violet luminous and pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho plays as, in his life, he had never played before; he is in one
      of those instants when one feels tempered by strength, light, weighing
      nothing, and when it is a pure joy to move, to extend one's arms, to leap.
      But Arrochkoa weakens, the vicar is fettered two or three times by his
      black cassock, and the adverse camp, at first distanced, little by little
      catches up, then, in presence of this game so valiantly disputed, clamor
      redoubles and caps fly in the air, thrown by enthusiastic hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the points are equal on both sides; the crier announces thirty for
      each one of the rival camps and he sings the old refrain which is of
      tradition immemorial in such cases: &ldquo;Let bets come forward! Give drink to
      the judges and to the players.&rdquo; It is the signal for an instant of rest,
      while wine shall be brought into the arena at the cost of the village. The
      players sit down, and Ramuntcho takes a place beside Gracieuse, who throws
      on his shoulders, wet with perspiration, the waistcoat which she was
      keeping for him, Then he asks of his little friend to undo the thongs
      which hold the glove of wood, wicker and leather on his reddened arm. And
      he rests in the pride of his success, seeing only smiles of greeting on
      the faces of the girls at whom he looks. But he sees also, on the side
      opposed to the players' wall, on the side of the approaching darkness, the
      archaic assemblage of Basque houses, the little square of the village with
      its kalsomined porches and its old plane-trees, then the old, massive
      belfry of the church, and, higher than everything, dominating everything,
      crushing everything, the abrupt mass of the Gizune from which comes so
      much shade, from which descends on this distant village so hasty an
      impression of night&mdash;Truly it encloses too much, that mountain, it
      imprisons, it impresses&mdash;And Ramuntcho, in his juvenile triumph, is
      troubled by the sentiment of this, by this furtive and vague attraction of
      other places so often mingled with his troubles and with his joys&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The game continues and his thoughts are lost in the physical intoxication
      of beginning the struggle again. From instant to instant, clack! the snap
      of the pelotas, their sharp noise against the glove which throws them or
      the wall which receives them, their same noise giving the notion of all
      the strength displayed&mdash;Clack! it will snap till the hour of
      twilight, the pelota, animated furiously by arms powerful and young. At
      times the players, with a terrible shock, stop it in its flight, with a
      shock that would break other muscles than theirs. Most often, sure of
      themselves, they let it quietly touch the soil, almost die: it seems as if
      they would never catch it: and clack! it goes off, however, caught just in
      time, thanks to a marvellous precision of the eye, and strikes the wall,
      ever with the rapidity of a bullet&mdash;When it wanders on the benches,
      on the mass of woolen caps and of pretty hair ornamented with silk
      kerchiefs, all the heads then, all the bodies, are lowered as if moved by
      the wind of its passage: for it must not be touched, it must not be
      stopped, as long as it is living and may still be caught; then, when it is
      really lost, dead, some one of the assistants does himself the honor to
      pick it up and throw it back to the players.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night falls, falls, the last golden colors scatter with serene
      melancholy over the highest summits of the Basque country. In the deserted
      church, profound silence is established and antique images regard one
      another alone through the invasion of night&mdash;Oh! the sadness of ends
      of festivals, in very isolated villages, as soon as the sun sets&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Ramuntcho is more and more the great conqueror. And the
      plaudits, the cries, redouble his happy boldness; each time he makes a
      point the men, standing now on the old, graded, granite benches, acclaim
      him with southern fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last point, the sixtieth&mdash;It is Ramuntcho's and he has won the
      game!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there is a sudden crumbling into the arena of all the Basque caps
      which ornamented the stone amphitheatre; they press around the players who
      have made themselves immovable, suddenly, in tired attitudes. And
      Ramuntcho unfastens the thongs of his glove in the middle of a crowd of
      expansive admirers; from all sides, brave and rude hands are stretched to
      grasp his or to strike his shoulder amicably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you asked Gracieuse to dance with you this evening?&rdquo; asks Arrochkoa,
      who in this instant would do anything for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when she came out of the high mass I spoke to her&mdash;She has
      promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! I feared that mother&mdash;Oh! I would have arranged it, in any
      case; you may believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A robust old man with square shoulders, with square jaws, with a
      beardless, monkish face, before whom all bowed with respect, comes also:
      it is Haramburu, a player of the olden time who was celebrated half a
      century ago in America for the game of rebot, and who earned a small
      fortune. Ramuntcho blushes with pleasure at the compliment of this old
      man, who is hard to please. And beyond, standing on the reddish benches,
      among the long grasses and the November scabwort, his little friend, whom
      a group of young girls follows, turns back to smile at him, to send to him
      with her hand a gentle adios in the Spanish fashion. He is a young god in
      this moment, Ramuntcho; people are proud to know him, to be among his
      friends, to get his waistcoat for him, to talk to him, to touch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, with the other pelotaris, he goes to the neighboring inn, to a room
      where are placed the clean clothes of all and where careful friends
      accompany them to rub their bodies, wet with perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, a moment afterward, elegant in a white shirt, his cap on the side, he
      comes out of the door, under the plane-trees shaped like vaults, to enjoy
      again his success, see the people pass, continue to gather compliments and
      smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The autumnal day has declined, it is evening at present. In the lukewarm
      air, bats glide. The mountaineers of the surrounding villages depart one
      by one; a dozen carriages are harnessed, their lanterns are lighted, their
      bells ring and they disappear in the little shady paths of the valleys. In
      the middle of the limpid penumbra may be distinguished the women, the
      pretty girls seated on benches in front of the houses, under the vaults of
      the plane-trees; they are only clear forms, their Sunday costumes make
      white spots in the twilight, pink spots&mdash;and the pale blue spot which
      Ramuntcho looks at is the new gown of Gracieuse.&mdash;Above all, filling
      the sky, the gigantic Gizune, confused and sombre, is as if it were the
      centre and the source of the darkness, little by little scattered over all
      things. And at the church, suddenly the pious bells ring, recalling to
      distracted minds the enclosure where the graves are, the cypress trees
      around the belfry, and the entire grand mystery of the sky, of prayer, of
      inevitable death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the sadness of ends of festivals in very isolated villages, when the
      sun ceases to illuminate, and when it is autumn&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They know very well, these men who were so ardent a moment ago in the
      humble pleasures of the day, that in the cities there are other festivals
      more brilliant, more beautiful and less quickly ended; but this is
      something separate; it is the festival of the country, of their own
      country, and nothing can replace for them these furtive instants whereof
      they have thought for so many days in advance&mdash;Lovers who will depart
      toward the scattered houses flanking the Pyrenees, couples who to-morrow
      will begin over their monotonous and rude life, look at one another before
      separating, look at one another under the falling night, with regretful
      eyes that say: &ldquo;Then, it is finished already? Then, that is all?&mdash;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Eight o'clock in the evening. They have dined at the cider mill, all the
      players except the vicar, under the patronage of Itchoua; they have
      lounged for a long time afterward, languid in the smoke of smuggled
      cigarettes and listening to the marvellous improvisations of the two
      Iragola brothers, of the Mendiazpi mountain&mdash;while outside, on the
      street, the girls in small groups holding one another's arms, looked at
      the windows, found pleasure in observing on the smoky panes the round
      shadows of the heads of the men covered with similar caps&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, on the square, the brass band plays the first measures of the
      fandango, and the young men, the young girls, all those of the village and
      several also of the mountain who have remained to dance, arrive in
      impatient groups. There are some dancing already on the road, not to lose
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      And soon the fandango turns, turns, in the light of the new moon the horns
      of which seem to pose, lithe and light, on the enormous and heavy
      mountain. In the couples that dance without ever touching each other,
      there is never a separation; before one another always and at an equal
      distance, the boy and the girl make evolutions with a rhythmic grace, as
      if they were tied together by some invisible magnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has gone into hiding, the crescent of the moon, fallen, one would
      think, in the black mountain; then lanterns are brought and hooked to the
      trunks of the plane-trees and the young men can see better their partners
      who, opposite them swing with an air of fleeing continually, but without
      increasing their distance ever: almost all pretty, their hair elegantly
      dressed, a kerchief on the neck, and wearing with ease gowns in the
      fashion of to-day. The men, somewhat grave always, accompany the music
      with snaps of their fingers in the air: shaven and sunburnt faces to which
      labor in the fields, in smuggling or at sea, has given a special thinness,
      almost ascetic; still, by the ampleness of their brown necks, by the width
      of their shoulders, one divines their great strength, the strength of that
      old, sober and religious race.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fandango turns and oscillates, to the tune of an ancient waltz. All
      the arms, extended and raised, agitate themselves in the air, rise or fall
      with pretty, cadenced motions following the oscillations of bodies. The
      rope soled sandals make this dance silent and infinitely light; one hears
      only the frou-frou of gowns, and ever the snap of fingers imitating the
      noise of castanets. With a Spanish grace, the girls, whose wide sleeves
      expand like wings, swing their tightened waists above their vigorous and
      supple hips&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Facing one another, Ramuntcho and Gracieuse said nothing at first,
      captivated by the childish joy of moving quickly in cadence, to the sound
      of music. It is very chaste, that manner of dancing without the slightest
      touch of bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were also, in the course of the evening, waltzes and quadrilles,
      and even walks arm-in-arm during which the lovers could touch each other
      and talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my Ramuntcho,&rdquo; said Gracieuse, &ldquo;it is of that game that you expect
      to make your future, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were walking now arm-in-arm, under the plane-trees shedding their
      leaves in the night of November, lukewarm as a night of May, during an
      interval of silence when the musicians were resting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Ramuntcho, &ldquo;in our country it is a trade, like any other,
      where one may earn a living, as long as strength lasts&mdash;and one may
      go from time to time to South America, you know, as Irun and Gorosteguy
      have done, and bring back twenty, thirty thousand francs for a season,
      earned honestly at Buenos Ayres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Americas&mdash;&rdquo; exclaimed Gracieuse in a joyful enthusiasm&mdash;&ldquo;the
      Americas, what happiness! It was always my wish to go across the sea to
      those countries!&mdash;And we would look for your uncle Ignacio, then go
      to my cousin, Bidegaina, who has a farm on the Uruguay, in the prairies&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
She ceased talking, the little girl who had never gone out of that
village which the mountains enclose; she stopped to think of these
far-off lands which haunted her young head because she had, like most
Basques, nomadic ancestors&mdash;folks who are called here Americans or
Indians, who pass their adventurous lives on the other side of the ocean
and return to the cherished village only very late, to die. And, while
she dreamed, her nose in the air, her eyes in the black of the clouds
and of the summits, Ramuntcho felt his blood running faster, his
heart beating quicker in the intense joy of what she had just said so
spontaneously. And, inclining his head toward her, he asked, as if to
jest, in a voice infinitely soft and childish:

 &ldquo;We would go? Is that what you said: we would go, you with me? This
signifies therefore that you would consent, a little later, when we
become of age, to marry me?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He perceived through the darkness the gentle black light of Gracieuse's
      eyes, which rose toward him with an expression of astonishment and of
      reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;you did not know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to make you say it, you see&mdash;You had never said it to me,
      do you know?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held tighter the arm of his little betrothed and their walk became
      slower. It is true that they had never said it, not only because it seemed
      to them that it was not necessary to say, but especially because they were
      stopped at the moment of speaking by a sort of terror&mdash;the terror of
      being mistaken about each other's sentiment&mdash;and now they knew, they
      were sure. Then they had the consciousness of having passed together the
      grave and solemn threshold of life. And, leaning on one another, they
      faltered, almost, in their slackened promenade, like two children
      intoxicated by youthfulness, joy and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you think your mother will consent?&rdquo; said Ramuntcho timidly, after
      the long, delightful silence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is the trouble,&rdquo; replied the little girl with a sigh of anxiety&mdash;&ldquo;Arrochkoa,
      my brother, will be for us, it is probable. But mother?&mdash;Will mother
      consent?&mdash;But, it will not happen soon, in any case&mdash;You have to
      serve in the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, if you do not want me to! No, I need not serve! I am a Guipuzcoan,
      like my mother; I shall be enrolled only if I wish to be&mdash;Whatever
      you say, I'll do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Ramuntcho, I would like better to wait for you longer and that you
      become naturalized, and that you become a soldier like the others. I tell
      you this, since you ask&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, is it what you wish? Well, so much the better. Oh, to be a
      Frenchman or a Spaniard is indifferent to me. I shall do as you wish. I
      like as well one as the other: I am a Basque like you, like all of us; I
      care not for the rest! But as for being a soldier somewhere, on this side
      of the frontier or on the other, yes, I prefer it. In the first place, one
      who goes away looks as if he were running away; and then, it would please
      me to be a soldier, frankly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my Ramuntcho, since it is all the same to you, serve as a soldier
      in France, to please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is understood, Gatchutcha!&mdash;You will see me wearing red trousers.
      I shall call on you in the dress of a soldier, like Bidegarray, like
      Joachim. As soon as I have served my three years, we will marry, if your
      mother consents!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment of silence Gracieuse said, in a low, solemn voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, my Ramuntcho&mdash;I am like you: I am afraid of her&mdash;of my
      mother&mdash;But listen&mdash;if she refuses, we shall do together
      anything, anything that you wish, for this is the only thing in the world
      in which I shall not obey her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, silence returned between them, now that they were engaged, the
      incomparable silence of young joys, of joys new and not yet tried, which
      need to hush, which need to meditate in order to understand themselves
      better in their profoundness. They walked in short steps and at random
      toward the church, in the soft obscurity which the lanterns troubled no
      longer, intoxicated by their innocent contact and by feeling that they
      were walking together in the path where no one had followed them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the noise of the brass instruments suddenly arose anew, in a sort of
      slow waltz, oddly rhythmic. And the two children, at the fandango's
      appeal, without having consulted each other, and as if it was a compulsory
      thing which may not be disputed, ran, not to lose a moment, toward the
      place where the couples were dancing. Quickly, quickly placing themselves
      opposite each other, they began again to swing in measure, without talking
      to each other, with the same pretty gestures of their arms, the same
      supple motions of their hips. From time to time, without loss of step or
      distance, both ran, in a direct line like arrows. But this was only an
      habitual variation of the dance,&mdash;and, ever in measure, quickly, as
      if they were gliding, they returned to their starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracieuse had in dancing the same passionate ardor as in praying at the
      white chapels,&mdash;the same ardor which later doubtless, she would have
      in embracing Ramuntcho when caresses between them would not be forbidden.
      And at moments, at every fifth or sixth measure, at the same time as her
      light and strong partner, she turned round completely, the bust bent with
      Spanish grace, the head thrown backward, the lips half open on the
      whiteness of the teeth, a distinguished and proud grace disengaging itself
      from her little personality, still so mysterious, which to Ramuntcho only
      revealed itself a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all this beautiful evening of November, they danced before each
      other, mute and charming, with intervals of promenade in which they hardly
      talked&mdash;intoxicated in silence by the delicious thought with which
      their minds were filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, until the curfew rang in the church, this dance under the branches of
      autumn, these little lanterns, this little festival in this corner closed
      to the world, threw a little light and joyful noise into the vast night
      which the mountains, standing everywhere like giants of shadow, made more
      dumb and more black.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is to be a grand ball-game next Sunday, for the feast of Saint
      Damasus, in the borough of Hasparitz.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrochkoa and Ramuntcho, companions in continual expeditions through the
      surrounding country, travelled for the entire day, in the little wagon of
      the Detcharry family, in order to organize that ball-game, which to them
      is a considerable event.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, they had to consult Marcos, one of the Iragola
      brothers. Near a wood, in front of his house in the shade, they found him
      seated on a stump of a chestnut tree, always grave and statuesque, his
      eyes inspired and his gesture noble, in the act of making his little
      brother, still in swaddling clothes, eat soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he the eleventh?&rdquo; they have asked, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Go on!&rdquo; the big eldest brother has replied, &ldquo;the eleventh is running
      already like a hare in the heather. This is number twelve!&mdash;little
      John the Baptist, you know, the latest, who, I think, will not be the
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, lowering their heads not to strike the branches, they had
      traversed the woods, the forests of oaks under which extends infinitely
      the reddish lace of ferns.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they have traversed several villages also,&mdash;Basque villages, all
      grouped around these two things which are the heart of them and which
      symbolize their life: the church and the ball-game. Here and there, they
      have knocked at the doors of isolated houses, tall and large houses,
      carefully whitewashed, with green shades, and wooden balconies where are
      drying in the sun strings of red peppers. At length they have talked, in
      their language so closed to strangers of France, with the famous players,
      the titled champions, the ones whose odd names have been seen in all the
      journals of the southwest, on all the posters of Biarritz or of
      Saint-Jean-de-Luz, and who, in ordinary life, are honest country
      inn-keepers, blacksmiths, smugglers, with waistcoat thrown over the
      shoulder and shirt sleeves rolled on bronze arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that all is settled and that the last words have been exchanged, it is
      too late to return that night to Etchezar; then, following their errant
      habits, they select for the night a village which they like, Zitzarry, for
      example, where they have gone often for their smuggling business. At the
      fall of night, then, they turn toward this place, which is near Spain.
      They go by the same little Pyrenean routes, shady and solitary under the
      old oaks that are shedding their leaves, among slopes richly carpeted with
      moss and rusty ferns. And now there are ravines where torrents roar, and
      then heights from which appear on all sides the tall, sombre peaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first it was cold, a real cold, lashing the face and the chest. But now
      gusts begin to pass astonishingly warm and perfumed with the scent of
      plants: the southern wind, rising again, bringing back suddenly the
      illusion of summer. And then, it becomes for them a delicious sensation to
      go through the air, so brusquely changed, to go quickly under the lukewarm
      breaths, in the noise of their horse's bells galloping playfully in the
      mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zitzarry, a smugglers' village, a distant village skirting the frontier. A
      dilapidated inn where, according to custom, the rooms for the men are
      directly above the stables, the black stalls. They are well-known
      travelers there, Arrochkoa and Ramuntcho, and while men are lighting the
      fire for them they sit near an antique, mullioned window, which overlooks
      the square of the ball-game and the church; they see the tranquil, little
      life of the day ending in this place so separated from the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this solemn square, the children practice the national game; grave and
      ardent, already strong, they throw their pelota against the wall, while,
      in a singing voice and with the needful intonation, one of them counts and
      announces the points, in the mysterious tongue of the ancestors. Around
      them, the tall houses, old and white, with warped walls, with projecting
      rafters, contemplate through their green or red windows those little
      players, so lithe, who run in the twilight like young cats. And the carts
      drawn by oxen return from the fields, with the noise of bells, bringing
      loads of wood, loads of gorse or of dead ferns&mdash;The night falls,
      falls with its peace and its sad cold. Then, the angelus rings&mdash;and
      there is, in the entire village, a tranquil, prayerful meditation&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ramuntcho, silent, worries about his destiny, feels as if he were a
      prisoner here, with his same aspirations always, toward something unknown,
      he knows not what, which troubles him at the approach of night. And his
      heart also fills up, because he is alone and without support in the world,
      because Gracieuse is in a situation different from his and may never be
      given to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Arrochkoa, very brotherly this time, in one of his good moments, slaps
      him on the shoulder as if he had understood his reverie, and says to him
      in a tone of light gaiety:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! it seems that you talked together, last night, sister and you&mdash;she
      told me about it&mdash;and that you are both prettily agreed!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho lifts toward him a long look of anxious and grave interrogation,
      which is in contrast with the beginning of their conversation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think,&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;of what we have said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my friend,&rdquo; replied Arrochkoa, become more serious also, &ldquo;on my word
      of honor, it suits me very well&mdash;And even, as I fear that there shall
      be trouble with mother, I promise to help you if you need help&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ramuntcho's sadness is dispelled as a little dust on which one has
      blown. He finds the supper delicious, the inn gay. He feels himself much
      more engaged to Gracieuse, now, when somebody is in the secret, and
      somebody in the family who does not repulse him. He had a presentiment
      that Arrochkoa would not be hostile to him, but his co-operation, so
      clearly offered, far surpasses Ramuntcho's hope&mdash;Poor little
      abandoned fellow, so conscious of the humbleness of his situation, that
      the support of another child, a little better established in life,
      suffices to return to him courage and confidence!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the uncertain and somewhat icy dawn, he awoke in his little room in the
      inn, with a persistent impression of his joy on the day before, instead of
      the confused anguish which accompanied so often in him the progressive
      return of his thoughts. Outside, were sounds of bells of cattle starting
      for the pastures, of cows lowing to the rising sun, of church bells,&mdash;and
      already, against the wall of the large square, the sharp snap of the
      Basque pelota: all the noises of a Pyrenean village beginning again its
      customary life for another day. And all this seemed to Ramuntcho the early
      music of a day's festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      At an early hour, they returned, Arrochkoa and he, to their little wagon,
      and, crushing their caps against the wind, started their horse at a gallop
      on the roads, powdered with white frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Etchezar, where they arrived at noon, one would have thought it was
      summer,&mdash;so beautiful was the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the little garden in front of her house, Gracieuse sat on a stone
      bench:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have spoken to Arrochkoa!&rdquo; said Ramuntcho to her, with a happy smile,
      as soon as they were alone&mdash;&ldquo;And he is entirely with us, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that,&rdquo; replied the little girl, without losing the sadly pensive air
      which she had that morning, &ldquo;oh, that!&mdash;my brother Arrochkoa, I
      suspected it, it was sure! A pelota player like you, you should know, was
      made to please him, in his mind there is nothing superior to that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your mother, Gatchutcha, for several days has acted much better to
      me, I think&mdash;For example, Sunday, you remember, when I asked you to
      dance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don't trust to that, my Ramuntcho! you mean day before yesterday,
      after the high mass?&mdash;It was because she had just talked with the
      Mother Superior, have you not noticed?&mdash;And the Mother Superior had
      insisted that I should not dance with you on the square; then, only to be
      contrary, you understand&mdash;But, don't rely on that, no&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied Ramuntcho, whose joy had already gone, &ldquo;it is true that they
      are not very friendly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friendly, mama and the Mother Superior?&mdash;Like a dog and a cat, yes!&mdash;Since
      there was talk of my going into the convent, do you not remember that
      story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remembered very well, on the contrary, and it frightened him still. The
      smiling and mysterious black nuns had tried once to attract to the peace
      of their houses that little blonde head, exalted and willful, possessed by
      an immense necessity to love and to be loved&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gatchutcha! you are always at the sisters', or with them; why so often?
      explain this to me: they are very agreeable to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sisters? no, my Ramuntcho, especially those of the present time, who
      are new in the country and whom I hardly know&mdash;for they change them
      often, you know&mdash;The sisters, no&mdash;I will even tell you that I am
      like mama about the Mother Superior. I cannot endure her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, what?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but what will you? I like their songs, their chapels, their houses,
      everything&mdash;I cannot explain that to you&mdash;Anyway, boys do not
      understand anything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little smile with which she said this was at once extinguished,
      changed into a contemplative expression or an absent expression, which
      Ramuntcho had often seen in her. She looked attentively in front of her,
      although there were on the road only the leafless trees, the brown mass of
      the crushing mountain; but it seemed as if Gracieuse was enraptured in
      melancholy ecstasy by things perceived beyond them, by things which the
      eyes of Ramuntcho could not distinguish&mdash;And during their silence the
      angelus of noon began to ring, throwing more peace on the tranquil village
      which was warming itself in the winter sun; then, bending their heads,
      they made naively together their sign of the cross&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when ceased to vibrate the holy bell, which in the Basque villages
      interrupts life as in the Orient the song of the muezzins, Ramuntcho
      decided to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It frightens me, Gatchutcha, to see you in their company always&mdash;I
      cannot but ask myself what ideas are in your head&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fixing on him the profound blackness of her eyes, she replied, in a tone
      of soft reproach:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is you talking to me in that way, after what we have said to each
      other Sunday night!&mdash;If I were to lose you, yes then, perhaps&mdash;surely,
      even!&mdash;But until then, oh! no&mdash;oh! you may rest in peace, my
      Ramuntcho&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bore for a long time her look, which little by little brought back to
      him entire delicious confidence, and at last he smiled with a childish
      smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he asked&mdash;&ldquo;I say silly things often, you know!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, at least, is the truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, one heard the sound of their laughter, which in two different
      intonations had the same freshness and the same youthfulness. Ramuntcho,
      with an habitual brusque and graceful gesture, changed his waistcoat from
      one shoulder to the other, pulled his cap on the side, and, with no other
      farewell than a sign of the head, they separated, for Dolores was coming
      from the end of the road.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Midnight, a winter night, black as Hades, with great wind and whipping
      rain. By the side of the Bidassoa, in the midst of a confused extent of
      ground with treacherous soil that evokes ideas of chaos, in slime that
      their feet penetrate, men are carrying boxes on their shoulders and,
      walking in the water to their knees, come to throw them into a long thing,
      blacker than night, which must be a bark&mdash;a suspicious bark without a
      light, tied near the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is again Itchoua's band, which this time will work by the river. They
      have slept for a few moments, all dressed, in the house of a receiver who
      lives near the water, and, at the needed hour, Itchoua, who never closes
      but one eye, has shaken his men; then, they have gone out with hushed
      tread, into the darkness, under the cold shower propitious to smuggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the road now, with the oars, to Spain whose fires may be seen at a
      distance, confused by the rain. The weather is let loose; the shirts of
      the men are already wet, and, under the caps pulled over their eyes, the
      wind slashes the ears. Nevertheless, thanks to the vigor of their arms,
      they were going quickly and well, when suddenly appeared in the obscurity
      something like a monster gliding on the waters. Bad business! It is the
      patrol boat which promenades every night. Spain's customs officers. In
      haste, they must change their direction, use artifice, lose precious time,
      and they are so belated already.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they have arrived without obstacle near the Spanish shore, among
      the large fishermen's barks which, on stormy nights, sleep there on their
      chains, in front of the &ldquo;Marine&rdquo; of Fontarabia. This is the perilous
      instant. Happily, the rain is faithful to them and falls still in
      torrents. Lowered in their skiff to be less visible, having ceased to
      talk, pushing the bottom with their oars in order to make less noise, they
      approach softly, softly, with pauses as soon as something has seemed to
      budge, in the midst of so much diffuse black, of shadows without outlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they are crouched against one of these large, empty barks and almost
      touching the earth. And this is the place agreed upon, it is there that
      the comrades of the other country should be to receive them and to carry
      their boxes to the receiving house&mdash;There is nobody there, however!&mdash;Where
      are they?&mdash;The first moments are passed in a sort of paroxysm of
      expectation and of watching, which doubles the power of hearing and of
      seeing. With eyes dilated, and ears extended, they watch, under the
      monotonous dripping of the rain&mdash;But where are the Spanish comrades?
      Doubtless the hour has passed, because of this accursed custom house
      patrol which has disarranged the voyage, and, believing that the
      undertaking has failed this time, they have gone back&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Several minutes flow, in the same immobility and the same silence. They
      distinguish, around them, the large, inert barks, similar to floating
      bodies of beasts, and then, above the waters, a mass of obscurities denser
      than the obscurities of the sky and which are the houses, the mountains of
      the shore&mdash;They wait, without a movement, without a word. They seem
      to be ghosts of boatmen near a dead city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little the tension of their senses weakens, a lassitude comes to
      them with the need of sleep&mdash;and they would sleep there, under this
      winter rain, if the place were not so dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Itchoua then consults in a low voice, in Basque language, the two eldest,
      and they decide to do a bold thing. Since the others are not coming, well!
      so much the worse, they will go alone, carry to the house over there, the
      smuggled boxes. It is risking terribly, but the idea is in their heads and
      nothing can stop them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; says Itchoua to Ramuntcho, in his manner which admits of no
      discussion, &ldquo;you shall be the one to watch the bark, since you have never
      been in the path that we are taking; you shall tie it to the bottom, but
      not too solidly, do you hear? We must be ready to run if the carbineers
      arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they go, all the others, their shoulders bent under the heavy loads,
      the rustling, hardly perceptible, of their march is lost at once on the
      quay which is so deserted and so black, in the midst of the monotonous
      dripping of the rain. And Ramuntcho, who has remained alone, crouches at
      the bottom of the skiff to be less visible becomes immovable again, under
      the incessant sprinkling of the rain, which falls now regular and
      tranquil.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are late, the comrades&mdash;and by degrees, in this inactivity and
      this silence, an irresistible numbness comes to him, almost a sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now a long form, more sombre than all that is sombre, passes by him,
      passes very quickly,&mdash;always in this same absolute silence which is
      the characteristic of these nocturnal undertakings: one of the large
      Spanish barks!&mdash;Yet, thinks he, since all are at anchor, since this
      one has no sails nor oars&mdash;then, what?&mdash;It is I, myself, who am
      passing!&mdash;and he has understood: his skiff was too lightly tied, and
      the current, which is very rapid here, is dragging him:&mdash;and he is
      very far away, going toward the mouth of the Bidassoa, toward the
      breakers, toward the sea&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      An anxiety has taken hold of him, almost an anguish&mdash;What will he do?&mdash;What
      complicates everything is that he must act without a cry of appeal,
      without a word, for, all along this coast, which seems to be the land of
      emptiness and of darkness, there are carbineers, placed in an interminable
      cordon and watching Spain every night as if it were a forbidden land&mdash;He
      tries with one of the long oars to push the bottom in order to return
      backward;&mdash;but there is no more bottom; he feels only the
      inconsistency of the fleeting and black water, he is already in the
      profound pass&mdash;Then, let him row, in spite of everything, and so much
      for the worse&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      With great trouble, his forehead perspiring, he brings back alone against
      the current the heavy bark, worried, at every stroke of the oar, by the
      small, disclosing grating that a fine ear over there might so well
      perceive. And then, one can see nothing more, through the rain grown
      thicker and which confuses the eyes; it is dark, dark as in the bowels of
      the earth where the devil lives. He recognizes no longer the point of
      departure where the others must be waiting for him, whose ruin he has
      perhaps caused; he hesitates, he waits, the ear extended, the arteries
      beating, and he hooks himself, for a moment's reflection, to one of the
      large barks of Spain&mdash;Something approaches then, gliding with
      infinite precaution on the surface of the water, hardly stirred: a human
      shadow, one would think, a silhouette standing:&mdash;a smuggler, surely,
      since he makes so little noise! They divine each other, and, thank God! it
      is Arrochkoa; Arrochkoa, who has untied a frail, Spanish skiff to meet him&mdash;So,
      their junction is accomplished and they are probably saved all, once more!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Arrochkoa, in meeting him, utters in a wicked voice, in a voice
      tightened by his young, feline teeth, one of those series of insults which
      call for immediate answer and sound like an invitation to fight. It is so
      unexpected that Ramuntcho's stupor at first immobilizes him, retards the
      rush of blood to his head. Is this really what his friend has just said
      and in such a tone of undeniable insult?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; replies Arrochkoa, somewhat softened and on his guard, observing
      in the darkness Ramuntcho's attitudes. &ldquo;Well! you had us almost caught,
      awkward fellow that you are!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silhouettes of the others appear in another bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are there,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;Let us go near them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ramuntcho takes his oarsman's seat with temples heated by anger, with
      trembling hands&mdash;no&mdash;he is Gracieuse's brother; all would be
      lost if Ramuntcho fought with him; because of her he will bend the head
      and say nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now their bark runs away by force of oars, carrying them all; the trick
      has been played. It was time; two Spanish voices vibrate on the black
      shore: two carbineers, who were sleeping in their cloaks and whom the
      noise has awakened!&mdash;And they begin to hail this flying, beaconless
      bark, not perceived so much as suspected, lost at once in the universal,
      nocturnal confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late, friends,&rdquo; laughs Itchoua, while rowing to the uttermost. &ldquo;Hail
      at your ease now and let the devil answer you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The current also helps them; they go into the thick obscurity with the
      rapidity of fishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There! Now they are in French waters, in safety, not far, doubtless, from
      the slime of the banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us stop to breathe a little,&rdquo; proposes Itchoua.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they raise their oars, halting, wet with perspiration and with rain.
      They are immovable again under the cold shower, which they do not seem to
      feel. There is heard in the vast silence only the breathing of chests,
      little by little quieted, the little music of drops of water falling and
      their light rippling. But suddenly, from this bark which was so quiet, and
      which had no other importance than that of a shadow hardly real in the
      midst of so much night, a cry rises, superacute, terrifying: it fills the
      emptiness and rents the far-off distances&mdash;It has come from those
      elevated notes which belong ordinarily to women only, but with something
      hoarse and powerful that indicates rather the savage male; it has the bite
      of the voice of jackals and it preserves, nevertheless, something human
      which makes one shiver the more; one waits with a sort of anguish for its
      end, and it is long, long, it is oppressive by its inexplicable length&mdash;It
      had begun like a stag's bell of agony and now it is achieved and it dies
      in a sort of laughter, sinister and burlesque, like the laughter of
      lunatics&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      However, around the man who has just cried thus in the front of the bark,
      none of the others is astonished, none budges. And, after a few seconds of
      silent peace, a new cry, similar to the first, starts from the rear,
      replying to it and passing through the same phases,&mdash;which are of a
      tradition infinitely ancient.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is simply the &ldquo;irrintzina&rdquo;, the great Basque cry which has been
      transmitted with fidelity from the depth of the abyss of ages to the men
      of our day, and which constitutes one of the strange characteristics of
      that race whose origins are enveloped in mystery. It resembles the cry of
      a being of certain tribes of redskins in the forests of America; at night,
      it gives the notion and the unfathomable fright of primitive ages, when,
      in the midst of the solitudes of the old world, men with monkey throats
      howled.
    </p>
    <p>
      This cry is given at festivals, or for calls of persons at night in the
      mountains, and especially to celebrate some joy, some unexpected good
      fortune, a miraculous hunt or a happy catch of fish in the rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they are amused, the smugglers, at this game of the ancestors; they
      give their voices to glorify the success of their undertaking, they yell,
      from the physical necessity to be compensated for their silence of a
      moment ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ramuntcho remains mute and without a smile. This sudden savagery
      chills him, although he has known it for a long time; it plunges him into
      dreams that worry and do not explain themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, he has felt to-night once more how uncertain and changing is his
      only support in the world, the support of that Arrochkoa on whom he should
      be able to count as on a brother; audacity and success at the ball-game
      will return that support to him, doubtless, but a moment of weakness,
      nothing, may at any moment make him lose it. Then it seems to him that the
      hope of his life has no longer a basis, that all vanishes like an unstable
      chimera.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      It was New Year's eve.
    </h3>
    <p>
      All the day had endured that sombre sky which is so often the sky of the
      Basque country&mdash;and which harmonizes well with the harsh mountains,
      with the roar of the sea, wicked, in the depths of the Bay of Biscay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the twilight of this last day of the year, at the hour when the fires
      retain the men around the hearths scattered in the country, at the hour
      when home is desirable and delicious, Ramuntcho and his mother were
      preparing to sit at the supper table, when there was a discreet knock at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who was coming to them from the night of the exterior, at the
      first aspect seemed unknown to them; only when he told his name (Jose
      Bidegarray, of Hasparitz) they recalled the sailor who had gone several
      years ago to America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, after accepting a chair, &ldquo;here is the message which I
      have been asked to bring to you. Once, at Rosario in Uruguay, as I was
      talking on the docks with several other Basque immigrants there, a man,
      who might have been fifty years old, having heard me speak of Etchezar,
      came to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Do you come from Etchezar?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No,' I replied, 'but I come from Hasparitz, which is not far from
      Etchezar.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he put questions to me about all your family. I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The old people are dead, the elder brother was killed in smuggling, the
      second has disappeared in America; there remain only Franchita and her
      son, Ramuntcho, a handsome young fellow who must be about eighteen years
      old today.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was thinking deeply while he was listening to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' he said at last, 'since you are going back there, you will say
      good-day to them for Ignacio.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after offering a drink to me he went away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Franchita had risen, trembling and paler than ever. Ignacio, the most
      adventurous in the family, her brother who had disappeared for ten years
      without sending any news&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      How was he? What face? Dressed how?&mdash;Did he seem happy, at least, or
      was he poorly dressed?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;he looked well, in spite of his gray hair; as
      for his costume, he appeared to be a man of means, with a beautiful gold
      chain on his belt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that was all he could say, with this naive and rude good-day of which
      he was the bearer; on the subject of the exile he knew no more and
      perhaps, until she died, Franchita would learn nothing more of that
      brother, almost non-existing, like a phantom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when he had emptied a glass of cider, he went on his road, the
      strange messenger, who was going to his village. Then, they sat at table
      without speaking, the mother and the son: she, the silent Franchita,
      absent minded, with tears shining in her eyes; he, worried also, but in a
      different manner, by the thought of that uncle living in adventures over
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he ceased to be a child, when Ramuntcho began to desert from school,
      to wish to follow the smugglers in the mountain, Franchita would say to
      him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, you take after your uncle Ignacio, we shall never make anything
      of you!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was true that he took after his uncle Ignacio, that he was
      fascinated by all the things that are dangerous, unknown and far-off&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night, therefore, if she did not talk to her son of the message which
      had just been transmitted to them, the reason was she divined his
      meditation on America and was afraid of his answers. Besides, among
      country people, the little profound and intimate dramas are played without
      words, with misunderstandings that are never cleared up, with phrases only
      guessed at and with obstinate silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as they were finishing their meal, they heard a chorus of young and
      gay voices, coming near, accompanied by a drum, the boys of Etchezar,
      coming for Ramuntcho to bring him with them in their parade with music
      around the village, following the custom of New Year's eve, to go into
      every house, drink in it a glass of cider and give a joyous serenade to an
      old time tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ramuntcho, forgetting Uruguay and the mysterious uncle, became a child
      again, in the pleasure of following them and of singing with them along
      the obscure roads, enraptured especially by the thought that they would go
      to the house of the Detcharry family and that he would see again, for an
      instant, Gracieuse.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The changeable month of March had arrived, and with it the intoxication of
      spring, joyful for the young, sad for those who are declining.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gracieuse had commenced again to sit, in the twilight of the
      lengthened days, on the stone bench in front of her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the old stone benches, around the houses, made, in the past ages, for
      the reveries of the soft evenings and for the eternally similar
      conversations of lovers&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracieuse's house was very ancient, like most houses in that Basque
      country, where, less than elsewhere, the years change the things.&mdash;It
      had two stories; a large projecting roof in a steep slope; walls like a
      fortress which were whitewashed every summer; very small windows, with
      settings of cut granite and green blinds. Above the front door, a granite
      lintel bore an inscription in relief; words complicated and long which, to
      French eyes resembled nothing known. It said: &ldquo;May the Holy Virgin bless
      this home, built in the year 1630 by Peter Detcharry, beadle, and his wife
      Damasa Irribarne, of the village of Istaritz.&rdquo; A small garden two yards
      wide, surrounded by a low wall so that one could see the passers-by,
      separated the house from the road; there was a beautiful rose-laurel,
      extending its southern foliage above the evening bench, and there were
      yuccas, a palm tree, and enormous bunches of those hortensias which are
      giants here, in this land of shade, in this lukewarm climate, so often
      enveloped by clouds. In the rear was a badly closed orchard which rolled
      down to an abandoned path, favorable to escalades of lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      What mornings radiant with light there were in that spring, and what
      tranquil, pink evenings!
    </p>
    <p>
      After a week of full moon which kept the fields till day-light blue with
      rays, and when the band of Itchoua ceased to work,&mdash;so clear was
      their habitual domain, so illuminated were the grand, vaporous backgrounds
      of the Pyrenees and of Spain&mdash;the frontier fraud was resumed more
      ardently, as soon as the thinned crescent had become discreet and early
      setting. Then, in these beautiful times, smuggling by night was exquisite;
      a trade of solitude and of meditation when the mind of the naive and very
      pardonable defrauders was elevated unconsciously in the contemplation of
      the sky and of the darkness animated by stars&mdash;as it happens to the
      mind of the sea folk watching, on the nocturnal march of vessels, and as
      it happened formerly to the mind of the shepherds in antique Chaldea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was favorable also and tempting for lovers, that tepid period which
      followed the full moon of March, for it was dark everywhere around the
      houses, dark in all the paths domed with trees,&mdash;and very dark,
      behind the Detcharry orchard, on the abandoned path where nobody ever
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracieuse lived more and more on her bench in front of her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was here that she was seated, as every year, to receive and look at the
      carnival dancers: those groups of young boys and of young girls of Spain
      or of France, who, every spring, organize themselves for several days in a
      wandering band, and, all dressed in the same pink or white colors,
      traverse the frontier village, dancing the fandango in front of houses,
      with castanets&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stayed later and later in this place which she liked, under the
      shelter of the rose-laurel coming into bloom, and sometimes even, she came
      out noiselessly through the window, like a little, sly fox, to breathe
      there at length, after her mother had gone to bed. Ramuntcho knew this
      and, every night, the thought of that bench troubled his sleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One clear April morning, they were walking to the church, Gracieuse and
      Ramuntcho. She, with an air half grave, half mocking, with a particular
      and very odd air, leading him there to make him do a penance which she had
      ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the holy enclosure, the flowerbeds of the tombs were coming into bloom
      again, as also the rose bushes on the walls. Once more the new saps were
      awakening above the long sleep of the dead. They went in together, through
      the lower door, into the empty church, where the old &ldquo;benoite&rdquo; in a black
      mantilla was alone, dusting the altars.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gracieuse had given to Ramuntcho the holy water and they had made
      their signs of the cross, she led him through the sonorous nave, paved
      with funereal stones, to a strange image on the wall, in a shady corner,
      under the men's tribunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a painting, impregnated with ancient mysticism, representing the
      figure of Jesus with eyes closed, forehead bloody, expression lamentable
      and dead; the head seemed to be cut off, separated from the body, and
      placed there on a gray linen cloth. Above, were written the long Litanies
      of the Holy Face, which have been composed, as everybody knows, to be
      recited in penance by repentant blasphemers. The day before, Ramuntcho, in
      anger, had sworn in an ugly manner: a quite unimaginable string of words,
      wherein the sacraments and the most saintly things were mingled with the
      horns of the devil and other villainous things still more frightful. That
      is why the necessity for a penance had impressed itself on the mind of
      Gracieuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my Ramuntcho,&rdquo; she recommended, as she walked away, &ldquo;omit nothing
      of what you must say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left him then in front of the Holy Face, beginning to murmur his
      litanies in a low voice, and went to the good woman and helped her to
      change the water of the white Easter daisies in front of the altar of the
      Virgin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the languorous evening returned, and Gracieuse was seated in the
      darkness meditating on her stone bench, a young human form started up
      suddenly near her; someone who had come in sandals, without making more
      noise than the silk owls make in the air, from the rear of the garden
      doubtless, after some scaling, and who stood there, straight, his
      waistcoat thrown over one shoulder: the one to whom were addressed all her
      tender emotions on earth, the one who incarnated the ardent dream of her
      heart and of her senses&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ramuntcho!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh! how you frightened me. Where did you come from
      at such an hour? What do you want? Why did you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I come? In my turn, to order you to do penance,&rdquo; he replied,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, tell the truth, what is the matter, what are you coming to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;To see you, only! That is what I come to do&mdash;What will you have! We
never see each other!&mdash;Your mother keeps me at a distance more and more
every day. I cannot live in that way.&mdash;We are not doing any harm, after
all, since we are to be married! And you know, I could come every night,
if you like, without anybody suspecting it&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no!&mdash;Oh! do not do that ever, I beg of you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked for an instant, and so low, so low, with more silence than
      words, as if they were afraid to wake up the birds in their nests. They
      recognized no longer the sound of their voices, so changed and so
      trembling they were, as if they had committed some delicious and damnable
      crime, by doing nothing but staying near each other, in the grand,
      caressing mystery of that night of April, which was hatching around them
      so many ascents of saps, so many germinations and so many loves&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not even dared to sit at her side; he remained standing, ready to
      run under the branches at the least alarm, like a nocturnal prowler.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when he prepared to go, it was she who asked, hesitating, and in
      a manner to be hardly heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;you will come back to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, under his growing mustache, he smiled at this sudden change of mind
      and he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, surely.&mdash;To-morrow and every night.&mdash;Every night when we
      shall not have to work in Spain.&mdash;I will come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho's lodging place was, in the house of his mother and above the
      stable, a room neatly whitewashed; he had there his bed, always clean and
      white, but where smuggling gave him few hours for sleep. Books of travel
      or cosmography, which the cure of the parish lent to him, posed on his
      table&mdash;unexpected in this house. The portraits, framed, of different
      saints, ornamented the walls, and several pelota-players' gloves were
      hanging from the beams of the ceiling, long gloves of wicker and of
      leather which seemed rather implements of hunting or fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franchita, at her return to her country, had bought back this house, which
      was that of her deceased parents, with a part of the sum given to her by
      the stranger at the birth of her son. She had invested the rest; then she
      worked at making gowns or at ironing linen for the people of Etchezar, and
      rented, to farmers of land near by, two lower rooms, with the stable where
      they placed their cows and their sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different familiar, musical sounds rocked Ramuntcho in his bed. First, the
      constant roar of a near-by torrent; then, at times, songs of nightingales,
      salutes to the dawn of divers birds. And, in this spring especially, the
      cows, his neighbors, excited doubtless by the smell of new-mown hay, moved
      all night, were agitated in dreams, making their bells tintillate
      continually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, after the long expeditions at night, he regained his sleep in the
      afternoon, extended in the shade in some corner of moss and grass. Like
      the other smugglers, he was not an early riser for a village boy, and he
      woke up sometimes long after daybreak, when already, between the
      disjointed planks of his flooring, rays of a vivid and gay light came from
      the stable below, the door of which remained open always to the rising sun
      after the departure of the cattle to their pastures. Then, he went to his
      window, pushed open the little, old blinds made of massive chestnut wood
      painted in olive, and leaned on his elbows, placed on the sill of the
      thick wall, to look at the clouds or at the sun of the new morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he saw, around his house, was green, green, magnificently green, as
      are in the spring all the corners of that land of shade and of rain. The
      ferns which, in the autumn, have so warm a rusty color, were now, in this
      April, in the glory of their greenest freshness and covered the slopes of
      the mountains as with an immense carpet of curly wool, where foxglove
      flowers made pink spots. In a ravine, the torrent roared under branches.
      Above, groups of oaks and of beeches clung to the slopes, alternating with
      prairies; then, above this tranquil Eden, toward the sky, ascended the
      grand, denuded peak of the Gizune, sovereign hill of the region of the
      clouds. And one perceived also, in the background, the church and the
      houses&mdash;that village of Etchezar, solitary and perched high on one of
      the Pyrenean cliffs, far from everything, far from the lines of
      communication which have revolutionized and spoiled the lowlands of the
      shores; sheltered from curiosity, from the profanation of strangers, and
      living still its Basque life of other days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho's awakenings were impregnated, at this window, with peace and
      humble serenity. They were full of joy, his awakenings of a man engaged,
      since he had the assurance of meeting Gracieuse at night at the promised
      place. The vague anxieties, the undefined sadness, which accompanied in
      him formerly the daily return of his thoughts, had fled for a time,
      dispelled by the reminiscence and the expectation of these meetings; his
      life was all changed; as soon as his eyes were opened he had the
      impression of a mystery and of an immense enchantment, enveloping him in
      the midst of this verdure and of these April flowers. And this peace of
      spring, thus seen every morning, seemed to him every time a new thing,
      very different from what it had been in the previous years, infinitely
      sweet to his heart and voluptuous to his flesh, having unfathomable and
      ravishing depths.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is Easter night, after the village bells have ceased to mingle in the
      air so many holy vibrations that came from Spain and from France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated on the bank of the Bidassoa, Ramuntcho and Florentino watch the
      arrival of a bark. A great silence now, and the bells sleep. The tepid
      twilight has been prolonged and, in breathing, one feels the approach of
      summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the night falls, it must appear from the coast of Spain, the
      smuggling bark, bringing the very prohibited phosphorus. And, without its
      touching the shore, they must go to get that merchandise, by advancing on
      foot in the bed of the river, with long, pointed sticks in their hands, in
      order to assume, if perchance they were caught, airs of people fishing
      innocently for &ldquo;platuches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The water of the Bidassoa is to-night an immovable and clear mirror, a
      little more luminous than the sky, and in this mirror, are reproduced,
      upside down, all the constellations, the entire Spanish mountain, carved
      in so sombre a silhouette in the tranquil atmosphere. Summer, summer, one
      has more and more the consciousness of its approach, so limpid and soft
      are the first signs of night, so much lukewarm langour is scattered over
      this corner of the world, where the smugglers silently manoeuvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this estuary, which separates the two countries, seems in this moment
      to Ramuntcho more melancholy than usual, more closed and more walled-in in
      front of him by these black mountains, at the feet of which hardly shine,
      here and there, two or three uncertain lights. Then, he is seized again by
      his desire to know what there is beyond, and further still.&mdash;Oh! to
      go elsewhere!&mdash;To escape, at least for a time, from the
      oppressiveness of that land&mdash;so loved, however!&mdash;Before death,
      to escape the oppressiveness of this existence, ever similar and without
      egress. To try something else, to get out of here, to travel, to know
      things&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, while watching the far-off, terrestrial distances where the bark
      will appear, he raises his eyes from time to time toward what happens
      above, in the infinite, looks at the new moon, the crescent of which, as
      thin as a line, lowers and will disappear soon; looks at the stars, the
      slow and regulated march of which he has observed, as have all the people
      of his trade, during so many nocturnal hours; is troubled in the depth of
      his mind by the proportions and the inconceivable distances of these
      things.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In his village of Etchezar, the old priest who had taught him the
      catechism, interested by his young, lively intelligence, has lent books to
      him, has continued with him conversations on a thousand subjects, and, on
      the subject of the planets, has given to him the notion of movements and
      of immensities, has half opened before his eyes the grand abyss of space
      and duration. Then, in his mind, innate doubts, frights and despairs that
      slumbered, all that his father had bequeathed to him as a sombre
      inheritance, all these things have taken a black form which stands before
      him. Under the great sky of night, his Basque faith has commenced to
      weaken. His mind is no longer simple enough to accept blindly dogmas and
      observances, and, as all becomes incoherence and disorder in his young
      head, so strangely prepared, the course of which nobody is leading, he
      does not know that it is wise to submit, with confidence in spite of
      everything, to the venerable and consecrated formulas, behind which is
      hidden perhaps all that we may ever see of the unknowable truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, these bells of Easter which the year before had filled him with
      a religious and soft sentiment, this time had seemed to him to be a music
      sad and almost vain. And now that they have just hushed, he listens with
      undefined sadness to the powerful noise, almost incessant since the
      creation, that the breakers of the Bay of Biscay make and which, in the
      peaceful nights, may be heard in the distance behind the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his floating dream changes again.&mdash;Now the estuary, which has
      become quite dark and where one may no longer see the mass of human
      habitations, seems to him, little by little, to become different; then,
      strange suddenly, as if some mystery were to be accomplished in it; he
      perceives only the great, abrupt lines of it, which are almost eternal,
      and he is surprised to think confusedly of times more ancient, of an
      unprecise and obscure antiquity.&mdash;The Spirit of the old ages, which
      comes out of the soil at times in the calm nights, in the hours when sleep
      the beings that trouble us in the day-time, the Spirit of the old ages is
      beginning, doubtless, to soar in the air around him; Ramuntcho does not
      define this well, for his sense of an artist and of a seer, that no
      education has refined, has remained rudimentary; but he has the notion and
      the worry of it.&mdash;In his head, there is still and always a chaos,
      which seeks perpetually to disentangle itself and never succeeds.&mdash;However,
      when the two enlarged and reddened horns of the moon fall slowly behind
      the mountain, always black, the aspect of things takes, for an
      inappreciable instant, one knows not what ferocious and primitive airs;
      then, a dying impression of original epochs which had remained, one knows
      not where in space, takes for Ramuntcho a precise form in a sudden manner,
      and troubles him until he shivers. He dreams, even without wishing it, of
      those men of the forests who lived here in the ages, in the uncalculated
      and dark ages, because, suddenly, from a point distant from the shore, a
      long Basque cry rises from the darkness in a lugubrious falsetto, an
      &ldquo;irrintzina,&rdquo; the only thing in this country with which he never could
      become entirely familiar. But a great mocking noise occurs in the
      distance, the crash of iron, whistles: a train from Paris to Madrid, which
      is passing over there, behind them, in the black of the French shore. And
      the Spirit of the old ages folds its wings made of shade and vanishes.
      Silence returns: but after the passage of this stupid and rapid thing, the
      Spirit which has fled reappears no more&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, the bark which Ramuntcho awaited with Florentino appears, hardly
      perceptible for other eyes than theirs, a little, gray form which leaves
      behind it slight ripples on this mirror which is of the color of the sky
      at night and wherein stars are reflected upside down. It is the
      well-selected hour, the hour when the customs officers watch badly; the
      hour also when the view is dimmer, when the last reflections of the sun
      and those of the crescent of the moon have gone out, and the eyes of men
      are not yet accustomed to darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then to get the prohibited phosphorus, they take their long fishing
      sticks, and go into the water silently.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a grand ball-game arranged for the following Sunday at
      Erribiague, a far-distant village, near the tall mountains. Ramuntcho,
      Arrochkoa and Florentino were to play against three celebrated ones of
      Spain; they were to practice that evening, limber their arms on the square
      of Etchezar, and Gracieuse, with other little girls of her age, had taken
      seats on the granite benches to look at them. The girls, all pretty; with
      elegant airs in their pale colored waists cut in accordance with the most
      recent vagary of the season. And they were laughing, these little girls,
      they were laughing! They were laughing because they had begun laughing,
      without knowing why. Nothing, a word of their old Basque tongue, without
      any appropriateness, by one of them, and there they were all in spasms of
      laughter.&mdash;This country is truly one of the corners of the world
      where the laughter of girls breaks out most easily, ringing like clear
      crystal, ringing youthfulness and fresh throats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrochkoa had been there for a long time, with the wicker glove at his
      arm, throwing alone the pelota which, from time to time, children picked
      up for him. But Ramuntcho, Florentino, what were they thinking of? How
      late they were! They came at last, their foreheads wet with perspiration,
      their walk heavy and embarrassed. And, while the little, laughing girls
      questioned them, in that mocking tone which girls, when they are in a
      troupe, assume ordinarily to interpellate boys, these smiled, and each one
      struck his chest which gave a metallic sound.&mdash;Through paths of the
      Gizune, they had returned on foot from Spain, heavy with copper coin
      bearing the effigy of the gentle, little King Alfonso XIII. A new trick of
      the smugglers: for Itchoua's account, they had exchanged over there with
      profit, a big sum of money for this debased coin, destined to be
      circulated at par at the coming fairs, in different villages of the Landes
      where Spanish cents are current. They were bringing, in their pockets, in
      their shirts, some forty kilos of copper. They made all this fall like
      rain on the antique granite of the benches, at the feet of the amused
      girls, asking them to keep and count it for them; then, after wiping their
      foreheads and puffing a little, they began to play and to jump, being
      light now and lighter than ordinarily, their overload being disposed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except three or four children of the school who ran like young cats after
      the lost pelotas, there were only the girls, seated in a group on the
      lowest one of these deserted steps, the old, reddish stones of which bore
      at this moment their herbs and their flowers of April. Calico gowns, clear
      white or pink waists, they were all the gaiety of this solemnly sad place.
      Beside Gracieuse was Pantchika Dargaignaratz, another fifteen year old
      blonde, who was engaged to Arrochkoa and would soon marry him, for he,
      being the son of a widow, had not to serve in the army. And, criticizing
      the players, placing in lines on the granite rows of piled-up copper
      cents, they laughed, they whispered, in their chanted accent, with ends of
      syllables in &ldquo;rra&rdquo; or in &ldquo;rrik,&rdquo; making the &ldquo;r's&rdquo; roll so sharply that one
      would have thought every instant sparrows were beating their wings in
      their mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also, the boys, were laughing, and they came frequently, under the
      pretext of resting, to sit among the girls. These troubled and intimidated
      them three times more than the public, because they mocked so!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho learned from his little betrothed something which he would not
      have dared to hope for: she had obtained her mother's permission to go to
      that festival of Erribiague, see the ball-game and visit that country,
      which she did not know. It was agreed that she should go in a carriage,
      with Pantchika and Madame Dargaignaratz; and they would meet over there;
      perhaps it would be possible to return all together.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the two weeks since their evening meetings had begun, this was the
      first time when he had had the opportunity to talk to her thus in the
      day-time and before the others&mdash;and their manner was different, more
      ceremonious apparently, with, beneath it, a very suave mystery. It was a
      long time, also, since he had seen her so well and so near in the
      daylight: she was growing more beautiful that spring; she was pretty,
      pretty!&mdash;Her bust had become rounder and her waist thinner; her
      manner gained, day by day, an elegant suppleness. She resembled her
      brother still, she had the same regular features, the same perfect oval of
      the face; but the difference in their eyes went on increasing: while those
      of Arrochkoa, of a blue green shade which seemed fleeting, avoided the
      glances of others, hers, on the contrary, black pupils and lashes, dilated
      themselves to look at you fixedly. Ramuntcho had seen eyes like these in
      no other person; he adored the frank tenderness of them and also their
      anxious and profound questioning. Long before he had become a man and
      accessible to the trickery of the senses, those eyes had caught, of his
      little, childish mind, all that was best and purest in it.&mdash;And now
      around such eyes, the grand Transformer, enigmatic and sovereign, had
      placed a beauty of flesh which irresistibly called his flesh to a supreme
      communion.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were made very inattentive to their game, the players, by the group
      of little girls, of white and pink waists, and they laughed themselves at
      not playing so well as usual. Above them, occupying only a small corner of
      the old, granite amphitheatre, ascended rows of empty benches in ruins;
      then, the houses of Etchezar, so peacefully isolated from the rest of the
      world; then, in fine, the obscure, encumbering mass of the Gizune, filling
      up the sky and mingling with thick clouds asleep on its sides. Clouds
      immovable, inoffensive and without a threat of rain; clouds of spring,
      which were of a turtle-dove color and which seemed tepid, like the air of
      that evening. And, in a rent, much less elevated than the summit
      predominating over this entire site, a round moon began to silver as the
      day declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      They played, in the beautiful twilight, until the hour when the first bats
      appeared, until the hour when the flying pelota could hardly be seen in
      the air. Perhaps they felt, unconsciously, that the moment was rare and
      might not be regained: then, as much as possible, they should prolong it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And at last, they went together to take to Itchoua his Spanish coins. In
      two lots, they had been placed in two thick, reddish towels which a boy
      and a girl held at each end, and they walked in cadence, singing the tune
      of &ldquo;The Linen Weaver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How long, clear and soft was that twilight of April!&mdash;There were
      roses and all sorts of flowers in front of the walls of the venerable,
      white houses with brown or green blinds. Jessamine, honeysuckle and linden
      filled the air with fragrance. For Gracieuse and Ramuntcho, it was one of
      those exquisite hours which later, in the anguishing sadness of
      awakenings, one recalls with a regret at once heart-breaking and charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! who shall say why there are on earth evenings of spring, and eyes so
      pretty to look at, and smiles of young girls, and breaths of perfumes
      which gardens exhale when the nights of April fall, and all this delicious
      cajoling of life, since it is all to end ironically in separation, in
      decrepitude and in death&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day, Friday, was organized the departure for this village where
      the festival was to take place on the following Sunday. It is situated
      very far, in a shady region, at the turn of a deep gorge, at the foot of
      very high summits. Arrochkoa was born there and he had spent there the
      first months of his life, in the time when his father lived there as a
      brigadier of the French customs; but he had left too early to have
      retained the least memory of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the little Detcharry carriage, Gracieuse, Pantchita and, with a long
      whip in her hand, Madame Dargaignaratz, her mother, who is to drive, leave
      together at the noon angelus to go over there directly by the mountain
      route.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho, Arrochkoa and Florentino, who have to settle smuggling affairs
      at Saint-Jean-de-Luz, go by a roundabout way which will bring them to
      Erribiague at night, on the train which goes from Bayonne to Burguetta.
      To-day, all three are heedless and happy; Basque caps never appeared above
      more joyful faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night is falling when they penetrate, by this little train of
      Burguetta, into the quiet, interior country. The carriages are full of a
      gay crowd, a spring evening crowd, returning from some festival, young
      girls with silk kerchiefs around their necks, young men wearing woolen
      caps; all are singing, laughing and kissing. In spite of the invading
      obscurity one may still distinguish the hedges, white with hawthorn, the
      woods white with acacia flowers; into the open carriages penetrates a
      fragrance at once violent and suave, which the country exhales. And on all
      this white bloom of April, which the night little by little effaces, the
      train throws in passing a furrow of joy, the refrain of some old song of
      Navarre, sung and resung infinitely by these girls and these boys, in the
      noise of the wheels and of the steam&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Erribiague! At the doors, this name, which makes all three start, is
      cried. The singing band had already stepped out, leaving them almost alone
      in the train, which had become silent. High mountains had made the night
      very thick&mdash;and the three were almost sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astounded, they jump down, in the midst of an obscurity which even their
      smugglers' eyes cannot pierce. Stars above hardly shine, so encumbered is
      the sky by the overhanging summits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the village?&rdquo; they ask of a man who is there alone to receive
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three miles from here on the right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They begin to distinguish the gray trail of a road, suddenly lost in the
      heart of the shade. And in the grand silence, in the humid coolness of
      these valleys full of darkness, they walk without talking, their gaiety
      somewhat darkened by the black majesty of the peaks that guard the
      frontier here.
    </p>
    <p>
      They come, at last, to an old, curved bridge over a torrent; then, to the
      sleeping village which no light indicates. And the inn, where shines a
      lamp, is near by, leaning on the mountain, its base in the roaring water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men are led into their little rooms which have an air of
      cleanliness in spite of their extreme oldness: very low, crushed by their
      enormous beams, and bearing on their whitewashed walls images of the
      Christ, the Virgin and the saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, they go down to the supper tables, where are seated two or three old
      men in old time costume: white belt, black blouse, very short, with a
      thousand pleats. And Arrochkoa, vain of his parentage, hastens to ask them
      if they have not known Detcharry, who was here a brigadier of the customs
      eighteen years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the old men scans his face:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are his son, I would bet! You look like him! Detcharry, do I
      remember Detcharry!&mdash;He took from me two hundred lots of merchandise!&mdash;That
      does not matter, here is my hand, even if you are his son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the old defrauder, who was the chief of a great band, without rancor,
      with effusion, presses Arrochkoa's two hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detcharry has remained famous at Erribiague for his stratagems, his
      ambuscades, his captures of contraband goods, out of which came, later,
      his income that Dolores and her children enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Arrochkoa assumes a proud air, while Ramuntcho lowers his head,
      feeling that he is of a lower condition, having no father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not in the customhouse, as your deceased father was?&rdquo; continued
      the old man in a bantering tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not exactly.&mdash;Quite the reverse, even&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well! I understand!&mdash;Then, shake once more&mdash;and it's a sort
      of revenge on Detcharry for me, to know that his son has gone into
      smuggling like us!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They send for cider and they drink together, while the old men tell again
      the exploits and the tricks of former times, all the ancient tales of
      nights in the mountains; they speak a variety of Basque different from
      that of Etchezar, the village where the language is preserved more clearly
      articulated, more incisive, more pure, perhaps. Ramuntcho and Arrochkoa
      are surprised by this accent of the high land, which softens the words and
      which chants them; those white-haired story tellers seem to them almost
      strangers, whose talk is a series of monotonous stanzas, repeated
      infinitely as in the antique songs expressive of sorrow. And, as soon as
      they cease talking, the slight sounds in the sleep of the country come
      from peaceful and fresh darkness. The crickets chirp; one hears the
      torrent bubbling at the base of the inn; one hears the dripping of springs
      from the terrible, overhanging summits, carpeted with thick foliage.&mdash;It
      sleeps, the very small village, crouched and hidden in the hollow of a
      ravine, and one has the impression that the night here is a night blacker
      than elsewhere and more mysterious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; concludes the old chief, &ldquo;the customhouse and smuggling, at
      bottom, resemble each other; it is a game where the smartest wins, is it
      not? I will even say that, in my own opinion, an officer of customs,
      clever and bold, a customs officer like your father, for example, is as
      worthy as any of us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this, the hostess having come to say that it was time to put out the
      lamp&mdash;the last lamp still lit in the village&mdash;they go away, the
      old defrauders. Ramuntcho and Arrochkoa go up to their rooms, lie down and
      sleep, always in the chirp of the crickets, always in the sound of fresh
      waters that run or that fall. And Ramuntcho, as in his house at Etchezar,
      hears vaguely during his sleep the tinkling of bells, attached to the
      necks of cows moving in a dream, under him, in the stable.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now they open, to the beautiful April morning, the shutters of their
      narrow windows, pierced like portholes in the thickness of the very old
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly, it is a flood of light that dazzles their eyes. Outside, the
      spring is resplendent. Never had they seen, before this, summits so high
      and so near. But along the slopes full of leaves, along the mountains
      decked with trees, the sun descends to radiate in this valley on the
      whiteness of the village, on the kalsomine of the ancient houses with
      green shutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both awakened with veins full of youth and hearts full of joy. They have
      formed the project this morning to go into the country, to the house of
      Madame Dargaignaratz's cousins, and see the two little girls, who must
      have arrived the night before in the carriage, Gracieuse and Pantchika.&mdash;After
      a glance at the ball-game square, where they shall return to practice in
      the afternoon, they go on their way through small paths, magnificently
      green, hidden in the depths of the valleys, skirting the cool torrents.
      The foxglove flowers start everywhere like long, pink rockets above the
      light and infinite mass of ferns.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is at a long distance, it seems, that house of the Olhagarray cousins,
      and they stop from time to time to ask the way from shepherds, or they
      knock at the doors of solitary houses, here and there, under the cover of
      branches. They had never seen Basque houses so old nor so primitive, under
      the shade of chestnut trees so tall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ravines through which they advance are strangely enclosed. Higher than
      all these woods of oaks and of beeches, which seem as if suspended above,
      appear ferocious, denuded summits, a zone abrupt and bald, sombre brown,
      making points in the violent blue of the sky. But here, underneath, is the
      sheltered and mossy region, green and deep, which the sun never burns and
      where April has hidden its luxury, freshly superb.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they also, the two who are passing through these paths of foxglove and
      of fern, participate in this splendor of spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, in their enjoyment at being there, and under the
      influence of this ageless place, the old instincts to hunt and to destroy
      are lighted in the depths of their minds. Arrochkoa, excited, leaps from
      right to left, from left to right, breaks, uproots grasses and flowers;
      troubles about everything that moves in the green foliage, about the
      lizards that might be caught, about the birds that might be taken out of
      their nests, and about the beautiful trout swimming in the water; he
      jumps, he leaps; he wishes he had fishing lines, sticks, guns; truly he
      reveals his savagery in the bloom of his robust eighteen years.&mdash;Ramuntcho
      calms himself quickly; after breaking a few branches, plucking a few
      flowers, he begins to meditate; and he thinks&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they are stopped now at a cross-road where no human habitation is
      visible. Around them are gorges full of shade wherein grand oaks grow
      thickly, and above, everywhere, a piling up of mountains, of a reddish
      color burned by the sun. There is nowhere an indication of the new times;
      there is an absolute silence, something like the peace of the primitive
      epochs. Lifting their heads toward the brown peaks, they perceive at a
      long distance persons walking on invisible paths, pushing before them
      donkeys of smugglers: as small as insects at such a distance, are these
      silent passers-by on the flank of the gigantic mountain; Basques of other
      times, almost confused, as one looks at them from this place, with this
      reddish earth from which they came&mdash;and where they are to return,
      after having lived like their ancestors without a suspicion of the things
      of our times, of the events of other places&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They take off their caps, Arrochkoa and Ramuntcho, to wipe their
      foreheads; it is so warm in these gorges and they have run so much, jumped
      so much, that their entire bodies are in a perspiration. They are enjoying
      themselves, but they would like to come, nevertheless, near the two
      little, blonde girls who are waiting for them. But of whom shall they ask
      their way now, since there is no one?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ave Maria,&rdquo; cries at them from the thickness of the branches an old,
      rough voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the salutation is prolonged by a string of words spoken in a rapid
      decrescendo, quick; quick; a Basque prayer rattled breathlessly, begun
      very loudly, then dying at the finish. And an old beggar comes out of the
      fern, all earthy, all hairy, all gray, bent on his stick like a man of the
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Arrochkoa, putting his hand in his pocket, &ldquo;but you must take
      us to the Olhagarray house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Olhagarray house,&rdquo; replies the old man. &ldquo;I have come from it, my
      children, and you are near it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth, how had they failed to see, at a hundred steps further, that
      black gable among branches of chestnut trees?
    </p>
    <p>
      At a point where sluices rustle, it is bathed by a torrent, that
      Olhagarray house, antique and large, among antique chestnut trees. Around,
      the red soil is denuded and furrowed by the waters of the mountain;
      enormous roots are interlaced in it like monstrous gray serpents; and the
      entire place, overhung on all sides by the Pyrenean masses, is rude and
      tragic.
    </p>
    <p>
      But two young girls are there, seated in the shade; with blonde hair and
      elegant little pink waists; astonishing little fairies, very modern in the
      midst of the ferocious and old scenes.&mdash;They rise, with cries of joy,
      to meet the visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been better, evidently, to enter the house and salute the
      old people. But the boys say to themselves that they have not been seen
      coming, and they prefer to sit near their sweethearts, by the side of the
      brook, on the gigantic roots. And, as if by chance, the two couples manage
      not to bother one another, to remain hidden from one another by rocks, by
      branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      There then, they talk at length in a low voice, Arrochkoa with Pantchika,
      Ramuntcho with Gracieuse. What can they be saying, talking so much and so
      quickly?
    </p>
    <p>
      Although their accent is less chanted than that of the highland, which
      astonished them yesterday, one would think they were speaking scanned
      stanzas, in a sort of music, infinitely soft, where the voices of the boys
      seem voices of children.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are they saying to one another, talking so much and so quickly,
      beside this torrent, in this harsh ravine, under the heavy sun of noon?
      What they are saying has not much sense; it is a sort of murmur special to
      lovers, something like the special song of the swallows at nesting time.
      It is childish, a tissue of incoherences and repetitions. No, what they
      are saying has not much sense&mdash;unless it be what is most sublime in
      the world, the most profound and truest things which may be expressed by
      terrestrial words.&mdash;It means nothing, unless it be the eternal and
      marvellous hymn for which alone has been created the language of men and
      beasts, and in comparison with which all is empty, miserable and vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat is stifling in the depth of that gorge, so shut in from all
      sides; in spite of the shade of the chestnut trees, the rays, that the
      leaves sift, burn still. And this bare earth, of a reddish color, the
      extreme oldness of this nearby house, the antiquity of these trees, give
      to the surroundings, while the lovers talk, aspects somewhat harsh and
      hostile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho has never seen his little friend made so pink by the sun: on her
      cheeks, there is the beautiful, red blood which flushes the skin, the fine
      and transparent skin; she is pink as the foxglove flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flies, mosquitoes buzz in their ears. Now Gracieuse has been bitten on the
      chin, almost on the mouth, and she tries to touch it with the end of her
      tongue, to bite the place with the upper teeth. And Ramuntcho, who looks
      at this too closely, feels suddenly a langour, to divert himself from
      which he stretches himself like one trying to awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      She begins again, the little girl, her lip still itching&mdash;and he
      again stretches his arms, throwing his chest backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, Ramuntcho, and why do you stretch yourself like a
      cat?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when, for the third time, Gracieuse bites the same place, and shows
      again the little tip of her tongue, he bends over, vanquished by the
      irresistible giddiness, and bites also, takes in his mouth, like a
      beautiful red fruit which one fears to crush, the fresh lip which the
      mosquito has bitten&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence of fright and of delight, during which both shiver, she as much
      as he; she trembling also, in all her limbs, for having felt the contact
      of the growing black mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not angry, tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;No, my Ramuntcho.&mdash;Oh, I am not angry, no&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then he begins again, quite frantic, and in this languid and warm air,
      they exchange for the first time in their lives, the long kisses of lovers&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day, Sunday, they went together religiously to hear one of the
      masses of the clear morning, in order to return to Etchezar the same day,
      immediately after the grand ball-game. It was this return, much more than
      the game, that interested Gracieuse and Ramuntcho, for it was their hope
      that Pantchika and her mother would remain at Erribiague while they would
      go, pressed against each other, in the very small carriage of the
      Detcharry family, under the indulgent and slight watchfulness of
      Arrochkoa, five or six hours of travel, all three alone, on the spring
      roads, under the new foliage, with amusing halts in unknown villages&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o'clock in the morning, on that beautiful Sunday, the square was
      encumbered by mountaineers come from all the summits, from all the savage,
      surrounding hamlets. It was an international match, three players of
      France against three of Spain, and, in the crowd of lookers-on, the
      Spanish Basques were more numerous; there were large sombreros, waistcoats
      and gaiters of the olden time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judges of the two nations, designated by chance, saluted each other
      with a superannuated politeness, and the match began, in profound silence,
      under an oppressive sun which annoyed the players, in spite of their caps,
      pulled down over their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho soon, and after him Arrochkoa, were acclaimed as victors. And
      people looked at the two little strangers, so attentive, in the first row,
      so pretty also with their elegant pink waists, and people said: &ldquo;They are
      the sweethearts of the two good players.&rdquo; Then Gracieuse, who heard
      everything, felt proud of Ramuntcho.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noon. They had been playing for almost an hour. The old wall, with its
      summit curved like a cupola, was cracking from dryness and from heat,
      under its paint of yellow ochre. The grand Pyrenean masses, nearer here
      than at Etchezar, more crushing and more high, dominated from everywhere
      these little, human groups, moving in a deep fold of their sides. And the
      sun fell straight on the heavy caps of the men, on the bare heads of the
      women, heating the brains, increasing enthusiasm. The passionate crowd
      yelled, and the pelotas were flying, when, softly, the angelus began to
      ring. Then an old man, all wrinkled, all burned, who was waiting for this
      signal, put his mouth to the clarion&mdash;his old clarion of a Zouave in
      Africa&mdash;and rang the call to rest. And all, the women who were seated
      rose; all the caps fell, uncovering hair black, blonde or white, and the
      entire people made the sign of the cross, while the players, with chests
      and foreheads streaming with perspiration, stopped in the heat of the game
      and stood in meditation with heads bent&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At two o'clock, the game having come to an end gloriously for the French,
      Arrochkoa and Ramuntcho went in their little wagon, accompanied and
      acclaimed by all the young men of Erribiague; then Gracieuse sat between
      the two, and they started for their long, charming trip, their pockets
      full of the gold which they had earned, intoxicated by their joy, by the
      noise and by the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ramuntcho, who retained the taste of yesterday's kiss, felt like
      shouting to them: &ldquo;This little girl who is so pretty, as you see, is mine!
      Her lips are mine, I had them yesterday and will take them again
      to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They started and at once found silence again, in the shaded valleys
      bordered by foxglove and ferns&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      To roll for hours on the small Pyrenean roads, to change places almost
      every day, to traverse the Basque country, to go from one village to
      another, called here by a festival, there by an adventure on the frontier&mdash;this
      was now Ramuntcho's life, the errant life which the ball-game made for him
      in the day-time and smuggling in the night-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascents, descents, in the midst of a monotonous display of verdure. Woods
      of oaks and of beeches, almost inviolate, and remaining as they were in
      the quiet centuries.&mdash;When he passed by some antique house, hidden in
      these solitudes of trees, he stopped to enjoy reading, above the door, the
      traditional legend inscribed in the granite: &ldquo;Ave Maria! in the year 1600,
      or in the year 1500, such a one, from such a village, has built this
      house, to live in it with such a one, his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very far from all human habitation, in a corner of a ravine, where it was
      warmer than elsewhere, sheltered from all breezes, they met a peddler of
      holy images, who was wiping his forehead. He had set down his basket, full
      of those colored prints with gilt frames that represent saints with
      Euskarian legends, and with which the Basques like to adorn their old
      rooms with white walls. And he was there, exhausted from fatigue and heat,
      as if wrecked in the ferns, at a turn of those little, mountain routes
      which run solitary under oaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracieuse came down and bought a Holy Virgin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later,&rdquo; she said to Ramuntcho, &ldquo;we shall put it in our house as a
      souvenir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the image, dazzling in its gold frame, went with them under the long,
      green vaults&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out of their path, for they wished to pass by a certain valley
      of the Cherry-trees, not in the hope of finding cherries in it, in April,
      but to show to Gracieuse the place, which is renowned in the entire Basque
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost five o'clock, the sun was already low, when they reached
      there. It was a shaded and calm region, where the spring twilight
      descended like a caress on the magnificence of the April foliage. The air
      was cool and suave, fragrant with hay, with acacia. Mountains&mdash;very
      high, especially toward the north, to make the climate there softer,
      surrounded it on all sides, investing it with a melancholy mystery of
      closed Edens.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, when the cherry-trees appeared, they were a gay surprise, they were
      already red.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nobody on these paths, above which the grand cherry-trees
      extended like a roof, their branches dripping with coral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there were some summer houses, still uninhabited, some deserted
      gardens, invaded by the tall grass and the rose bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, they made their horse walk; then, each one in his turn, transferring
      the reins and standing in the wagon, amused himself by eating these
      cherries from the trees while passing by them and without stopping.
      Afterward, they placed bouquets of them in their buttonholes, they culled
      branches of them to deck the horse's head, the harness and the lantern.
      The equipage seemed ornamented for some festival of youth and of joy&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let us hurry,&rdquo; said Gracieuse. &ldquo;If only it be light enough, at least,
      when we reach Etchezar, for people to see us pass, ornamented as we are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for Ramuntcho, he thought of the meeting place in the evening, of the
      kiss which he would dare to repeat, similar to that of yesterday, taking
      Gracieuse's lip between his lips like a cherry&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      May! The grass ascends, ascends from everywhere like a sumptuous carpet,
      like silky velvet, emanating spontaneously from the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to sprinkle this region of the Basques, which remains humid and
      green all summer like a sort of warmer Brittany, the errant vapors on the
      Bay of Biscay assemble all in this depth of gulf, stop at the Pyrenean
      summits and melt into rain. Long showers fall, which are somewhat
      deceptive, but after which the soil smells of new flowers and hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fields, along the roads, the grasses quickly thicken; all the
      ledges of the paths are as if padded by the magnificent thickness of the
      bent grass; everywhere is a profusion of gigantic Easter daisies, of
      buttercups with tall stems, and of very large, pink mallows like those of
      Algeria.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in the long, tepid twilights, pale iris or blue ashes in color, every
      night the bells of the month of Mary resound for a long time in the air,
      under the mass of the clouds hooked to the flanks of the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the month of May, with the little group of black nuns, with
      discreet babble, with puerile and lifeless laughter, Gracieuse, at all
      hours, went to church. Hastening their steps under the frequent showers,
      they went together through the graveyard, full of roses; together, always
      together, the little clandestine betrothed, in light colored gowns, and
      the nuns, with long, mourning veils; during the day they brought bouquets
      of white flowers, daisies and sheafs of tall lilies; at night they came to
      sing, in the nave still more sonorous than in the day-time, the softly
      joyful canticles of the Virgin Mary:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ave, Queen of the Angels! Star of the Sea, ave!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the whiteness of the lilies lighted by the tapers, their white petals
      and their yellow pollen in gold dust! Oh, their fragrance in the gardens
      or in the church, during the twilights of spring!
    </p>
    <p>
      And as soon as Gracieuse entered there, at night, in the dying ring of the
      bells&mdash;leaving the pale half-light of the graveyard full of roses for
      the starry night of the wax tapers which reigned already in the church,
      quitting the odor of hay and of roses for that of incense and of the tall,
      cut lilies, passing from the lukewarm and living air outside to that heavy
      and sepulchral cold that centuries amass in old sanctuaries&mdash;a
      particular calm came at once to her mind, a pacifying of all her desires,
      a renunciation of all her terrestrial joys. Then, when she had knelt, when
      the first canticles had taken their flight under the vault, infinitely
      sonorous, little by little she fell into an ecstasy, a state of dreaming,
      a visionary state which confused, white apparitions traversed: whiteness,
      whiteness everywhere; lilies, thousands of sheafs of lilies, and white
      wings, shivers of white wings of angels&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! to remain for a long time in that state, to forget all things, and to
      feel herself pure, sanctified and immaculate, under that glance, ineffably
      fascinating and soft, under that glance, irresistibly appealing, which the
      Holy Virgin, in long white vestments, let fall from the height of the
      tabernacle&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when she went outside, when the night of spring re-enveloped her with
      tepid breezes of life, the memory of the meeting which she had promised
      the day before, the day before as well as every day, chased like the wind
      of a storm the visions of the church. In the expectation of Ramuntcho, in
      the expectation of the odor of his hair, of the touch of his mustache, of
      the taste of his lips, she felt near faltering, like one wounded, among
      the strange companions who accompanied her, among the peaceful and
      spectral black nuns.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the hour had come, in spite of all her resolutions she was there,
      anxious and ardent, listening to the least noise, her heart beating if a
      branch of the garden moved in the night&mdash;tortured by the least
      tardiness of the beloved one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came always with his same silent step of a rover at night, his
      waistcoat on his shoulder, with as much precaution and artifice as for the
      most dangerous act of smuggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the rainy nights, so frequent in the Basque spring-time, she remained
      in her room on the first floor, and he sat on the sill of the open window,
      not trying to go in, not having the permission to do so. And they stayed
      there, she inside, he outside, their arms laced, their heads touching each
      other, the cheek of one resting on the cheek of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the weather was beautiful, she jumped over this low window-sill to
      wait for him outside, and their long meetings, almost without words,
      occurred on the garden bench. Between them there were not even those
      continual whisperings familiar to lovers; no, there were rather silences.
      At first they did not dare to talk, for fear of being discovered, for the
      least murmurs of voices at night are heard. And then, as nothing new
      threatened their lives, what need had they to talk? What could they have
      said which would have been better than the long contact of their joined
      hands and of their heads resting against each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      The possibility of being surprised kept them often on the alert, in an
      anxiety which made more delicious afterward the moments when they forgot
      themselves more, their confidence having returned.&mdash;Nobody frightened
      them as much as Arrochkoa, a smart, nocturnal prowler himself, and always
      so well-informed about the goings and comings of Ramuntcho&mdash;In spite
      of his indulgence, what would he do, if he discovered them?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the old stone benches, under branches, in front of the doors of
      isolated houses, when fall the lukewarm nights of spring!&mdash;Theirs was
      a real lovers' hiding place, and there was for them, every night, a music,
      for, in all the stones of the neighbors' wall lived those singing
      tree-toads, beasts of the south, which, as soon as night fell, gave from
      moment to moment a little, brief note, discreet, odd, having the tone of a
      crystal bell and of a child's throat. Something similar might be produced
      by touching here and there, without ever resting on them, the scales of an
      organ with a celestial voice. There were tree-toads everywhere, responding
      to one another in different tones; even those which were under their
      bench, close by them, reassured by their immobility, sang also from time
      to time; then that little sound, brusque and soft, so near, made them
      start and smile. All the exquisite, surrounding obscurity was animated by
      that music, which continued in the distance, in the mystery of the leaves
      and of the stones, in the depths of all the small, black holes of rocks or
      walls; it seemed like chivies in miniature, or rather, a sort of frail
      concert somewhat mocking&mdash;oh! not very mocking, and without any
      maliciousness&mdash;led timidly by inoffensive gnomes. And this made the
      night more living and more loving&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      After the intoxicated audacities of the first nights, fright took a
      stronger hold of them, and, when one of them had something special to say,
      one led the other by the hand without talking; this meant that they had to
      walk softly, softly, like marauding cats, to an alley behind the house
      where they could talk without fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall we live, Gracieuse?&rdquo; asked Ramuntcho one night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your house, I had thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, so thought I&mdash;only I thought it would make you sad to be so
      far from the parish, from the church and the square&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;with you, I could find anything sad?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, we would send away those who live on the first floor and take the
      large room which opens on the road to Hasparitz&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an increased joy for him to know that Gracieuse would accept his
      house, to be sure that she would bring the radiance of her presence into
      that old, beloved home, and that they would make their nest there for life&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Here come the long, pale twilights of June, somewhat veiled like those of
      May, less uncertain, however, and more tepid still. In the gardens, the
      rose-laurel which is beginning to bloom in profusion is becoming already
      magnificently pink. At the end of each work day, the good folks sit
      outside, in front of their doors, to look at the night falling&mdash;the
      night which soon confuses, under the vaults of the plane-trees, their
      groups assembled for benevolent rest. And a tranquil melancholy descends
      over villages, in those interminable evenings&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      For Ramuntcho, this is the epoch when smuggling becomes a trade almost
      without trouble, with charming hours, marching toward summits through
      spring clouds; crossing ravines, wandering in lands of springs and of wild
      fig-trees; sleeping, waiting for the agreed hour, with carbineers who are
      accomplices, on carpets of mint and pinks.&mdash;The good odor of plants
      impregnated his clothes, his waistcoat which he never wore, but used as a
      pillow or a blanket&mdash;and Gracieuse would say to him at night: &ldquo;I know
      where you went last night, for you smell of mint of the mountain above
      Mendizpi&rdquo;&mdash;or: &ldquo;You smell of absinthe of the Subernoa morass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gracieuse regretted the month of Mary, the offices of the Virgin in the
      nave, decked with white flowers. In the twilights without rain, with the
      sisters and some older pupils of their class, she sat under the porch of
      the church, against the low wall of the graveyard from which the view
      plunges into the valleys beneath. There they talked, or played the
      childish games in which nuns indulge.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also long and strange meditations, meditations to which the
      fall of day, the proximity of the church, of the tombs and of their
      flowers, gave soon a serenity detached from material things and as if free
      from all alliance with the senses. In her first mystic dreams as a little
      girl,&mdash;inspired especially by the pompous rites of the cult, by the
      voice of the organ, the white bouquets, the thousand flames of the wax
      tapers&mdash;only images appeared to her&mdash;very radiant images, it is
      true: altars resting on mists, golden tabernacles where music vibrated and
      where fell grand flights of angels. But those visions gave place now to
      ideas: she caught a glimpse of that peace and that supreme renunciation
      which the certainty of an endless celestial life gives; she conceived, in
      a manner more elevated than formerly, the melancholy joy of abandoning
      everything in order to become an impersonal part of that entirety of nuns,
      white, or blue, or black, who, from the innumerable convents of earth,
      make ascend toward heaven an immense and perpetual intercession for the
      sins of the world&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as soon as night had fallen quite, the course of her thoughts
      came down every evening fatally toward intoxicating and mortal things. Her
      wait, her feverish wait, began, more impatient from moment to moment. She
      felt anxious that her cold companions with black veils should return into
      the sepulchre of their convent and that she should be alone in her room,
      free at last, in the house fallen asleep, ready to open her window and
      listen to the slight noise of Ramuntcho's footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kiss of lovers, the kiss on the lips, was now a thing possessed and of
      which they had not the strength to deprive themselves. And they prolonged
      it a great deal, not wishing, through charming scruples, to accord more to
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, if the intoxication which they gave to each other thus was a
      little too carnal, there was between them that absolute tenderness,
      infinite, unique, by which all things are elevated and purified.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho, that evening, had come to the meeting place earlier than usual&mdash;with
      more hesitation also in his walk, for one risks, on these June evenings,
      to find girls belated along the paths, or boys behind the hedges on love
      expeditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And by chance she was already alone, looking outside, without waiting for
      him, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once she noticed his agitated demeanor and guessed that something new
      had happened. Not daring to come too near, he made a sign to her to come
      quickly, jump over the window-sill, and meet him in the obscure alley
      where they talked without fear. Then, as soon as she was near him, in the
      nocturnal shade of the trees, he put his arm around her waist and
      announced to her, brusquely, the great piece of news which, since the
      morning, troubled his young head and that of Franchita, his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Ignacio has written.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True? Uncle Ignacio!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew that that adventurous uncle, that American uncle, who had
      disappeared for so many years, had never thought until now of sending more
      than a strange good-day by a passing sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! And he says that he has property there, which requires attention,
      large prairies, herds of horses; that he has no children, that if I wish
      to go and live near him with a gentle Basque girl married to me here, he
      would be glad to adopt both of us.&mdash;Oh! I think mother will come
      also.&mdash;So, if you wish.&mdash;We could marry now.&mdash;You know they
      marry people as young as we, it is allowed.&mdash;Now that I am to be
      adopted by my uncle and I shall have a real situation in life, your mother
      will consent, I think.&mdash;And as for military service, we shall not
      care for that, shall we?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat on the mossy rocks, their heads somewhat dizzy, troubled by the
      approach and the unforeseen temptation of happiness. So, it would not be
      in an uncertain future, after his term as a soldier, it would be almost at
      once; in two months, in one month, perhaps, that communion of their minds
      and of their flesh, so ardently desired and now so forbidden, might be
      accomplished without sin, honestly in the eyes of all, permitted and
      blessed.&mdash;Oh! they had never looked at this so closely.&mdash;And
      they pressed against each other their foreheads, made heavy by too many
      thoughts, fatigued suddenly by a sort of too delicious delirium.&mdash;Around
      them, the odor of the flowers of June ascended from the earth, filling the
      night with an immense suavity. And, as if there were not enough scattered
      fragrance, the jessamine, the honeysuckle on the walls exhaled from moment
      to moment, in intermittent puffs, the excess of their perfume; one would
      have thought that hands swung in silence censers in the darkness, for some
      hidden festival, for some enchantment magnificent and secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are often and everywhere very mysterious enchantments like this,
      emanating from nature itself, commanded by one knows not what sovereign
      will with unfathomable designs, to deceive us all, on the road to death&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not reply, Gracieuse, you say nothing to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could see that she was intoxicated also, like him, and yet he divined
      by her manner of remaining mute so long, that shadows were amassing over
      his charming and beautiful dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she asked at last, &ldquo;your naturalization papers. You have received
      them, have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they arrived last week, you know very well, and it was you who said
      that I should apply for them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are a Frenchman to-day.&mdash;Then, if you do not do your
      military service you are a deserter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&mdash;A deserter, no; but refractory, I think it is called.&mdash;It
      isn't better, since one cannot come back.&mdash;I was not thinking of that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How she was tortured now to have caused this thought, to have impelled him
      herself to this act which made soar over his hardly seen joy a threat so
      black! Oh, a deserter, he, her Ramuntcho! That is, banished forever from
      the dear, Basque country!&mdash;And this departure for America becomes
      suddenly frightfully grave, solemn, similar to a death, since he could not
      possibly return!&mdash;Then, what was there to be done?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they were anxious and mute, each one preferring to submit to the will
      of the other, and waiting, with equal fright, for the decision which
      should be taken, to go or to remain. From the depths of their two young
      hearts ascended, little by little, a similar distress, poisoning the
      happiness offered over there, in that America from which they would never
      return.&mdash;And the little, nocturnal censers of jessamine, of
      honeysuckle, of linden, continued to throw into the air exquisite puffs to
      intoxicate them; the darkness that enveloped them seemed more and more
      caressing and soft; in the silence of the village and of the country, the
      tree-toads gave, from moment to moment, their little flute-note, which
      seemed a very discreet love call, under the velvet of the moss; and,
      through the black lace of the foliage, in the serenity of a June sky which
      one thought forever unalterable, they saw scintillate, like a simple and
      gentle dust of phosphorus, the terrifying multitude of the worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curfew began to ring, however, at the church. The sound of that bell,
      at night especially, was for them something unique on earth. At this
      moment, it was something like a voice bringing, in their indecision, its
      advice, its counsel, decisive and tender. Mute still, they listened to it
      with an increasing emotion, of an intensity till then unknown, the brown
      head of the one leaning on the brown head of the other. It said, the
      advising voice, the dear, protecting voice: &ldquo;No, do not go forever; the
      far-off lands are made for the time of youth; but you must be able to
      return to Etchezar: it is here that you must grow old and die; nowhere in
      the world could you sleep as in this graveyard around the church, where
      one may, even when lying under the earth, hear me ring again&mdash;&rdquo; They
      yielded more and more to the voice of the bell, the two children whose
      minds were religious and primitive. And Ramuntcho felt on his cheek a tear
      of Gracieuse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I will not desert; I think that I would not have
      the courage to do it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the same thing as you, my Ramuntcho,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No, let us not
      do that. I was waiting for you to say it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he realized that he also was crying, like her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The die was cast, they would permit to pass by happiness which was within
      their reach, almost under their hands; they would postpone everything to a
      future uncertain and so far off&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, in the sadness, in the meditation of the great decision which
      they had taken, they communicated to each other what seemed best for them
      to do:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;write a pretty letter to your uncle Ignacio; write
      to him that you accept, that you will come with a great deal of pleasure
      immediately after your military service; you might even add, if you wish,
      that the one who is engaged to you thanks him and will be ready to follow
      you; but that decidedly you cannot desert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should you not talk to your mother now, Gatchutcha, only to know
      what she would think?&mdash;Because now, you understand, I am not as I
      was, an abandoned child&mdash;&rdquo; Slight steps behind them, in the path&mdash;and
      above the wall, the silhouette of a young man who had come on the tips of
      his sandals, as if to spy upon them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, escape, my Ramuntcho, we will meet to-morrow evening!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In half a second, there was nobody: he was hidden in a bush, she had fled
      into her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ended was their grave interview! Ended until when? Until to-morrow or
      until always?&mdash;On their farewells, abrupt or prolonged, frightened or
      peaceful, every time, every night, weighed the same uncertainty of their
      meeting again&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The bell of Etchezar, the same dear, old bell, that of the tranquil
      curfew, that of the festivals and that of the agonies, rang joyously in
      the beautiful sun of June. The village was decorated with white cloths,
      white embroideries, and the procession of the Fete-Dieu passed slowly, on
      a green strewing of fennel seed and of reeds cut from the marshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mountains seemed near and sombre, somewhat ferocious in their brown
      tones, above this white parade of little girls marching on a carpet of cut
      leaves and grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the old banners of the church were there, illuminated by that sun
      which they had known for centuries but which they see only once or twice a
      year, on the consecrated days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large one, that of the Virgin, in white silk embroidered with pale
      gold, was borne by Gracieuse, who walked in white dress, her eyes lost in
      a mystic dream. Behind the young girls, came the women, all the women of
      the village, wearing black veils, including Dolores and Franchita, the two
      enemies. Men, numerous enough, closed this cortege, tapers in their hands,
      heads uncovered&mdash;but there were especially gray hairs, faces with
      expressions vanquished and resigned, heads of old men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracieuse, holding high the banner of the Virgin, became at this hour one
      of the Illuminati; she felt as if she were marching, as after death,
      toward the celestial tabernacles. And when, at instants, the reminiscence
      of Ramuntcho's lips traversed her dream, she had the impression, in the
      midst of all this white, of a sharp stain, delicious still. Truly, as her
      thoughts became more elevated from day to day, what brought her back to
      him was less her senses, capable in her of being tamed, than true,
      profound tenderness, the one which resists time and deceptions of the
      flesh. And this tenderness was augmented by the fact that Ramuntcho was
      less fortunate than she and more abandoned in life, having had no father&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gatchutcha, you have at last spoken to your mother of Uncle
      Ignacio?&rdquo; asked Ramuntcho, very late, the same night, in the alley of the
      garden, under rays of the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, I have not dared.&mdash;How could I explain that I know all
      these things, since I am supposed not to talk with you ever, and she has
      forbidden me to do so?&mdash;Think, if I were to make her suspicious!&mdash;There
      would be an end to everything, we could not see each other again! I would
      like better to wait until you left the country, then all would be
      indifferent to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true!&mdash;let us wait, since I am to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was going away, and already they could count the evenings which would
      be left to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that they had permitted their immediate happiness to escape, the
      happiness offered to them in the prairies of America, it seemed preferable
      to them to hasten the departure of Ramuntcho for the army, in order that
      he might return sooner. So they had decided that he would enlist in the
      naval infantry, the only part of the service where one may elect to serve
      for a period as short as three years. And as they needed, in order to be
      certain not to be lacking in courage, a precise epoch, considered for a
      long time in advance, they had fixed the end of September, after the grand
      series of ball-games.
    </p>
    <p>
      They contemplated this separation of three years duration with an absolute
      confidence in the future, so sure they thought they were of each other,
      and of themselves, and of their imperishable love. But it was, however, an
      expectation which already filled their hearts strangely; it threw an
      unforeseen melancholy over things which were ordinarily the most
      indifferent, on the flight of days, on the least indications of the next
      season, on the coming into life of certain plants, on the coming into
      bloom of certain species of flowers, on all that presaged the arrival and
      the rapid march of their last summer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Already the fires of St. John have flamed, joyful and red in a clear, blue
      night, and the Spanish mountain seemed to burn, that night, like a sheaf
      of straw, so many were the bonfires lighted on its sides. It has begun,
      the season of light, of heat and of storms, at the end of which Ramuntcho
      must depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the saps, which in the spring went up so quickly, become languid
      already in the complete development of the verdure, in the wide bloom of
      the flowers. And the sun, more and more burning, overheats all the heads
      covered with Basque caps, excites ardor and passion, causes to rise
      everywhere, in those Basque villages, ferments of noisy agitation and of
      pleasure. While, in Spain, begin the grand bull-fights, this is here the
      epoch of so many ball-games, of so many fandangoes danced in the evening,
      of so much pining of lovers in the tepid voluptuousness of nights&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon will come the warm splendor of the southern July. The Bay of Biscay
      has become very blue and the Cantabric coast has for a time put on its
      fallow colors of Morocco or of Algeria.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the heavy rains alternates the marvellously beautiful weather which
      gives to the air absolute limpidities. And there are days also when
      somewhat distant things are as if eaten by light, powdered with sun dust;
      then, above the woods and the village of Etchezar, the Gizune, very
      pointed, becomes more vaporous and more high, and, on the sky, float, to
      make it appear bluer, very small clouds of a gilded white with a little
      mother-of-pearl gray in their shades.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the springs run thinner and rarer under the thickness of the ferns,
      and, along the routes, go more slowly, driven by half nude men, the
      ox-carts which a swarm of flies surrounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this season, Ramuntcho, in the day-time, lived his agitated life of a
      pelotari, running with Arrochkoa from village to village, to organize
      ball-games and play them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in his eyes, evenings alone existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evenings!&mdash;In the odorous and warm darkness of the garden, to be
      seated very near Gracieuse; to put his arm around her, little by little to
      draw her to him and hold her against his breast, and remain thus for a
      long time without saying anything, his chin resting on her hair, breathing
      the young and healthy scent of her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      He enervated himself dangerously, Ramuntcho, in these prolonged contacts
      which she did not prohibit. Anyway, he divined her surrendered enough to
      him now, and confident enough, to permit everything; but he did not wish
      to attempt supreme communion, through childish reserve, through respect
      for his betrothed, through excess and profoundness of love. And it
      happened to him at times to rise abruptly, to stretch himself&mdash;in the
      manner of a cat, she said, as formerly at Erribiague&mdash;when he felt a
      dangerous thrill and a more imperious temptation to leave life with her in
      a moment of ineffable death&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Franchita, however, was astonished by the unexplained attitude of her son,
      who, apparently, never saw Gracieuse and yet never talked of her. Then,
      while was amassing in her the sadness of his coming departure for military
      service, she observed him, with her peasant's patience and muteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, one of the last evenings, as he was going away, mysterious
      and in haste, long before the hour of the nocturnal contraband, she
      straightened before him, her eyes fixed on his:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And seeing him turn his head, blushing and embarrassed, she acquired a
      sudden certainty:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well, now I know.&mdash;Oh! I know!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was moved even more than he, at her discovery of this great secret.&mdash;The
      idea had not even come to her that it was not Gracieuse, that it might be
      another girl. She was too far-seeing. And her scruples as a Christian were
      awakened, her conscience was frightened at the evil that they might have
      done, as rose from the depth of her heart a sentiment of which she was
      ashamed as if it were a crime, a sort of savage joy.&mdash;For, in fine&mdash;if
      their carnal union was accomplished, the future of her son was assured.&mdash;She
      knew her Ramuntcho well enough to know that he would not change his mind
      and that Gracieuse would never be abandoned by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence between them was prolonged, she standing before him, barring
      the way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have you done together?&rdquo; she decided to ask. &ldquo;Tell me the truth,
      Ramuntcho, what wrong have you done?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wrong?&mdash;Oh! nothing, mother, nothing wrong, I swear to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replied this without irritation at being questioned, and bearing the
      look of his mother with eyes of frankness. It was true, and she believed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as she stayed in front of him, her hand on the door-latch, he said,
      with dumb violence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to prevent me from going to her, since I shall leave in
      three days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in presence of this young will in revolt, the mother, enclosing in
      herself the tumult of her contradictory thoughts, lowered her head and,
      without a word, stood aside to let him pass.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was their last evening, for, the day before yesterday, at the Mayor's
      office of Saint-Jean-de-Luz, he had, with a hand trembling a little,
      signed his engagement for three years in the Second naval infantry, whose
      garrison was a military port of the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was their last evening,&mdash;and they had said that they would make it
      longer than usual,&mdash;it would last till midnight, Gracieuse had
      decided: midnight, which in the villages is an unseasonable and black
      hour, an hour after which, she did not know why, all seemed to the little
      betrothed graver and guiltier.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the ardent desire of their senses, the idea had not come to
      one nor to the other that, during this last meeting, under the oppression
      of parting, something more might be attempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, at the instant so full of concentration of their
      farewell, they felt more chaste still, so eternal was their love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less prudent, however, since they had not to care for the morrow, they
      dared to talk there, on their lovers' bench, as they had never done
      before. They talked of the future, of a future which was for them very
      distant, because, at their age, three years seem infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three years, at his return, she would be twenty; then, if her mother
      persisted to refuse in an absolute manner, at the end of a year she would
      use her right of majority, it was between them an agreed and a sworn
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The means of correspondence, during the long absence of Ramuntcho,
      preoccupied them a great deal: between them, everything was so complicated
      by obstacles and secrets!&mdash;Arrochkoa, their only possible
      intermediary, had promised his help; but he was so changeable, so
      uncertain!&mdash;Oh, if he were to fail!&mdash;And then, would he consent
      to send sealed letters?&mdash;If he did not consent there would be no
      pleasure in writing.&mdash;In our time, when communications are easy and
      constant, there are no more of these complete separations similar to the
      one which theirs would be; they were to say to each other a very solemn
      farewell, like the one which the lovers of other days said, the lovers of
      the days when there were lands without post-offices, and distances that
      frightened one. The fortunate time when they should see each other again
      appeared to them situated far off, far off, in the depths of duration;
      yet, because of the faith which they had in each other, they expected this
      with a tranquil assurance, as the faithful expect celestial life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the least things of their last evening acquired in their minds a
      singular importance; as this farewell came near, all grew and was
      exaggerated for them, as happens in the expectation of death. The slight
      sounds and the aspects of the night seemed to them particular and, in
      spite of them, were engraving themselves forever in their memory. The song
      of the crickets had a characteristic which it seemed to them they had
      never heard before. In the nocturnal sonority, the barking of a watch-dog,
      coming from some distant farm, made them shiver with a melancholy fright.
      And Ramuntcho was to carry with him in his exile, to preserve later with a
      desolate attachment, a certain stem of grass plucked from the garden
      negligently and with which he had played unconsciously the whole evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      A phase of their life finished with that day: a lapse of time had
      occurred, their childhood had passed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of recommendations, they had none very long to exchange, so intensely was
      each one sure of what the other might do during the separation. They had
      less to say to each other than other engaged people have, because they
      knew mutually their most intimate thoughts. After the first hour of
      conversation, they remained hand in hand in grave silence, while were
      consumed the inexorable minutes of the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight, she wished him to go, as she had decided in advance, in her
      little thoughtful and obstinate head. Therefore, after having embraced
      each other for a long time, they quitted each other, as if the separation
      were, at this precise minute, an ineluctable thing which it was impossible
      to retard. And while she returned to her room with sobs that he heard, he
      scaled over the wall and, in coming out of the darkness of the foliage,
      found himself on the deserted road, white with lunar rays. At this first
      separation, he suffered less than she, because he was going, because it
      was he that the morrow, full of uncertainty, awaited. While he walked on
      the road, powdered and clear, the powerful charm of change, of travel,
      dulled his sensitiveness; almost without any precise thought, he looked at
      his shadow, which the moon made clear and harsh, marching in front of him.
      And the great Gizune dominated impassibly everything, with its cold and
      spectral air, in all this white radiance of midnight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The parting day, good-byes to friends here and there; joyful wishes of
      former soldiers returned from the regiment. Since the morning, a sort of
      intoxication or of fever, and, in front of him, everything unthought-of in
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrochkoa, very amiable on that last day, had offered to drive him in a
      wagon to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, and had arranged to go at sunset, in order to
      arrive there just in time for the night train.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night having come, inexorably, Franchita wished to accompany her son
      to the square, where the Detcharry wagon was waiting for him, and here her
      face, despite her will, was drawn by sorrow, while he straightened
      himself, in order to preserve the swagger which becomes recruits going to
      their regiment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make a little place for me, Arrochkoa,&rdquo; she said abruptly. &ldquo;I will sit
      between you to the chapel of Saint-Bitchentcho; I will return on foot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they started at the setting sun, which, on them as on all things,
      scattered the magnificence of its gold and of its red copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a wood of oaks, the chapel of Saint-Bitchentcho passed, and the
      mother wished to remain. From one turn to another, postponing every time
      the great separation, she asked to be driven still farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, when we reach the top of the Issaritz slope you must go down!&rdquo; he
      said tenderly. &ldquo;You hear, Arrochkoa, you will stop where I say; I do not
      want mother to go further&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Issaritz slope the horse had himself slackened his pace. The
      mother and the son, their eyes burned with suppressed tears, held each
      other's hands, and they were going slowly, slowly, in absolute silence, as
      if it were a solemn ascent toward some Calvary.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, at the top of the slope, Arrochkoa, who seemed mute also, pulled
      the reins slightly, with a simple little: &ldquo;Ho!&mdash;&rdquo; discreet as a
      lugubrious signal which one hesitates to give&mdash;and the carriage was
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, without a word, Ramuntcho jumped to the road, helped his mother to
      descend, gave a long kiss to her, then remounted briskly to his seat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, Arrochkoa, quickly, race, let us go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in two seconds, in the rapid descent, he lost sight of the one whose
      face at last was covered with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they were going away from one another, Franchita and her son. In
      different directions, they were walking on that Etchezar road,&mdash;in
      the splendor of the setting sun, in a region of pink heather and of yellow
      fern. She was going up slowly toward her home, meeting isolated groups of
      farmers, flocks led through the golden evening by little shepherds in
      Basque caps. And he was going down quickly, through valleys soon darkened,
      toward the lowland where the railway train passes&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At twilight, Franchita was returning from escorting her son and was trying
      to regain her habitual face, her air of haughty indifference, to pass
      through the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when she arrived in front of the Detcharry house, she saw Dolores
      who, instead of going in, as she intended, turned round and stood at the
      door to see her pass. Something new, some sudden revelation must have
      impelled her to take this attitude of aggressive defiance, this expression
      of provoking irony,&mdash;and Franchita then stopped, she also, while this
      phrase, almost involuntary, came through her set teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with that woman? Why does she look at me so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not come to-night, the lover, will he?&rdquo; responded the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you knew that he came here to see your daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth, Dolores knew this since the morning: Gracieuse had told her,
      since no care needed to be taken of the morrow; Gracieuse had told it
      wearily, after talking uselessly of Uncle Ignacio, of Ramuntcho's future,
      of all that would serve their cause&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you knew that he came here to see your daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By a reminiscence of other times, they regained instinctively their
      theeing and thouing of the sisters' school, those two women who for nearly
      twenty years had not addressed a word to each other. Why they detested
      each other, they hardly knew; so many times, it begins thus, with
      nothings, with jealousies, with childish rivalries, and then, at length,
      by dint of seeing each other every day without talking to each other, by
      dint of casting at each other evil looks, it ferments till it becomes
      implacable hatred.&mdash;Here they were, facing each other, and their two
      voices trembled with rancor, with evil emotion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;you knew it before I did, I suppose, you who
      are without shame and sent him to our house!&mdash;Anyway, one can
      understand your easiness about means, after what you have done in the past&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, while Franchita, naturally much more dignified, remained mute,
      terrified now by this unexpected dispute on the street, Dolores continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. My daughter marrying that penniless bastard, think of it!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have the idea that she will marry him, in spite of everything!&mdash;Try
      to propose to her a man of your choice and see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as if she disdained to continue, she went on her way, hearing behind
      her the voice and the insults of the other pursuing her. All her limbs
      trembled and she faltered at every step on her weakened legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the house, now empty, what sadness she found!
    </p>
    <p>
      The reality of this separation, which would last for three years, appeared
      to her under an aspect frightfully new, as if she had hardly been prepared
      for it&mdash;even as, on one's return from a graveyard, one feels for the
      first time, in its frightful integrity, the absence of the cherished dead&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, those words of insult in the street, those words the more
      crushing because she was cruelly conscious of her sin with the stranger!
      Instead of passing by, as she should have done, how had she found the
      courage to stop before her enemy and, by a phrase murmured between her
      teeth, provoke this odious dispute? How could she have descended to such a
      thing, forgotten herself thus, she who, for fifteen years, had imposed
      herself, little by little, on the respect of all by her demeanor, so
      perfectly dignified. Oh, to have attracted and to have suffered the insult
      of that Dolores,&mdash;whose past was irreproachable and who had, in
      effect, the right to treat her with contempt! When she reflected, she
      became frightened more and more by that sort of defiance of the future
      which she had had the imprudence to hurl; it seemed to her that she had
      compromised the cherished hope of her son in exasperating thus the hatred
      of that woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son!&mdash;her Ramuntcho, whom a wagon was carrying away from her at
      this hour in the summer night, was carrying away from her to a long
      distance, to danger, to war!&mdash;She had assumed very heavy
      responsibilities in directing his life with ideas of her own, with
      stubbornness, with pride, with selfishness.&mdash;And now, this evening,
      she had, perhaps, attracted misfortune to him, while he was going away so
      confident in the joy of his return!&mdash;This would be doubtless for her
      the supreme chastisement; she seemed to hear, in the air of the empty
      house, something like a threat of this expiation, she felt its slow and
      sure approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, she said for him her prayers, from a heart harshly revolted, because
      religion, as she understood it, remained without sweetness, without
      consolation, without anything confidential and tender. Her distress and
      her remorse were, at this moment, of so sombre a nature that tears,
      benevolent tears, came no longer to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he, at this same instant of the night, continued to descend, through
      darker valleys, toward the lowland where the trains pass&mdash;carrying
      away men to a long distance, changing and upsetting all things. For about
      an hour he would continue to be on Basque soil; then, it would end. Along
      his route, he met some oxcarts, of indolent demeanor, recalling the
      tranquillities of the olden time; or vague human silhouettes, hailing him
      with the traditional goodnight, the antique &ldquo;Gaou-one,&rdquo; which to-morrow he
      would cease to hear. And beyond, at his left, in the depth of a sort of
      black abyss, was the profile of Spain, Spain which, for a very long time
      doubtless, would trouble his nights no longer&mdash;

      which should have brought only joy without a cloud, since it announces his
      return, but which causes in her, on the contrary, tormented sentiments,
      for the happiness of seeing him again is poisoned now by sadness, by worry
      especially, by frightful worry&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, she had an exact presentiment of the sombre future, that night when,
      returning from escorting him on the road to departure, she returned to her
      house with so much anguish, after that sort of defiance hurled at Dolores
      on the street: it was cruelly true that she had broken then forever her
      son's life&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Months of waiting and of apparent calm had followed that scene, while
      Ramuntcho, far from his native land, was beginning his military service.
      Then, one day, a wealthy suitor had presented himself for Gracieuse and
      she, to the entire village's knowledge, had rejected him obstinately in
      spite of Dolores's will. Then, they had suddenly gone away, the mother and
      the daughter, pretexting a visit to relatives in the highland; but the
      voyage had been prolonged; a mystery more and more singular had enveloped
      this absence,&mdash;and suddenly the rumor had come that Gracieuse was a
      novice among the sisters of Saint Mary of the Rosary, in a convent of
      Gascony where the former Mother Superior of Etchezar was the abbess&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores had reappeared alone in her home, mute, with a desolate and evil
      air. None knew what influence had been exercised over the little girl with
      the golden hair, nor how the luminous doors of life had been closed before
      her, how she had permitted herself to be walled in that tomb; but, as soon
      as the period of novitiate had been accomplished, without seeing even her
      brother, she had taken her vows there, while Ramuntcho, in a far-off
      colonial war, ever distant from the post-offices of France, among the
      forests of a Southern island, won the stripes of a sergeant and a military
      medal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franchita had been almost afraid that he would never return, her son.&mdash;But
      at last, he was coming back. Between her fingers, thin and warm, she held
      the letter which said: &ldquo;I start day after to-morrow and I will be with you
      Saturday night.&rdquo; But what would he do, at his return, what would he make
      of his life, so sadly changed? In his letters, he had obstinately
      refrained from writing of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, everything had turned against her. The farmers, her tenants, had
      left Etchezar, leaving the barn empty, the house more lonely, and
      naturally her modest income was much diminished. Moreover, in an imprudent
      investment, she had lost a part of the money which the stranger had given
      for her son. Truly, she was too unskilful a mother, compromising in every
      way the happiness of her beloved Ramuntcho,&mdash;or rather, she was a
      mother upon whom justice from above fell heavily to-day, because of her
      past error.&mdash;And all this had vanquished her, all this had hastened
      and aggravated the malady which the physician, called too late, did not
      succeed in checking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, waiting for the return of her son, she was stretched on
      her bed, burning with fever.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      He was returning, Ramuntcho, after his three years of absence, discharged
      from the army in that city of the North where his regiment was in
      garrison. He was returning with his heart in disarray, with his heart in a
      tumult and in distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      His twenty-two year old face had darkened under the ardent sun; his
      mustache, now very long, gave him an air of proud nobility. And, on the
      lapel of the civilian coat which he had just bought, appeared the glorious
      ribbon of his medal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Bordeaux, where he had arrived after a night of travel, he had taken a
      place, with some emotion, in that train of Irun which descends in a direct
      line toward the South, through the monotony of the interminable moors.
      Near the right door he had installed himself in order to see sooner the
      Bay of Biscay open and the highlands of Spain sketch themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, near Bayonne, he had been startled at the sight of the first Basque
      caps, at the tall gates, the first Basque houses among the pines and the
      oaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at Saint-Jean-de-Luz at last, when he set foot on the soil, he had
      felt like one drunk&mdash;After the mist and the cold already begun in
      Northern France, he felt the sudden and voluptuous impression of a warmer
      climate, the sensation of going into a hothouse. There was a festival of
      sunlight that day; the southern wind, the exquisite southern wind, blew,
      and the Pyrenees had magnificent tints on the grand, free sky. Moreover,
      girls passed, whose laughter rang of the South and of Spain, who had the
      elegance and the grace of the Basques&mdash;and who, after the heavy
      blondes of the North, troubled him more than all these illusions of
      summer.&mdash;But promptly he returned to himself: what was he thinking
      of, since that regained land was to him an empty land forever? How could
      his infinite despair be changed by that tempting gracefulness of the
      girls, by that ironical gaiety of the sky, the human beings and the
      things?&mdash;No! He would go home, embrace his mother&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had expected, the stage-coach to Etchezar had left two hours ago.
      But, without trouble, he would traverse on foot this long road so familiar
      to him and arrive in the evening, before night.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went to buy sandals, the foot-gear of his former runs. And, with the
      mountaineer's quick step, in long, nervous strides, he plunged at once
      into the heart of the silent country, through paths which were for him
      full of memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      November was coming to an end in the tepid radiance of that sun which
      lingers always here for a long time, on the Pyrenean slopes. For days, in
      the Basque land, had lasted this same luminous and pure sky, above woods
      half despoiled of their leaves, above mountains reddened by the ardent
      tint of the ferns. From the borders of the paths ascended tall grasses, as
      in the month of May, and large, umbellated flowers, mistaken about the
      season; in the hedges, privets and briars had come into bloom again, in
      the buzz of the last bees; and one could see flying persistent
      butterflies, to whom death had given several weeks of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Basque houses appeared here and there among the trees,&mdash;very
      elevated, the roof protruding, white in their extreme oldness, with their
      shutters brown or green, of a green ancient and faded. And everywhere, on
      their wooden balconies were drying the yellow gold pumpkins, the sheafs of
      pink peas; everywhere, on their walls, like beautiful beads of coral, were
      garlands of red peppers: all the things of the soil still fecund, all the
      things of the old, nursing soil, amassed thus in accordance with old time
      usage, in provision for the darkened months when the heat departs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, after the mists of the Northern autumn, that limpidity of the air,
      that southern sunlight, every detail of the land, awakened in the complex
      mind of Ramuntcho infinite vibrations, painfully sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the tardy season when are cut the ferns that form the fleece of the
      reddish hills. And, large ox-carts filled with them rolled tranquilly, in
      the beautiful, melancholy sun, toward the isolated farms, leaving on their
      passage the trail of their fragrance. Very slowly, through the mountain
      paths, went these enormous loads of ferns; very slowly, with sounds of
      cow-bells. The harnessed oxen, indolent and strong,&mdash;all wearing the
      traditional head-gear of sheepskin, fallow colored, which gives to them
      the air of bisons or of aurochs, pulled those heavy carts, the wheels of
      which are solid disks, like those of antique chariots. The cowboys,
      holding the long stick in their hands, marched in front, always
      noiselessly, in sandals, the pink cotton shirt revealing the chest, the
      waistcoat thrown over the left shoulder&mdash;and the woolen cap drawn
      over a face shaven, thin, grave, to which the width of the jaws and of the
      muscles of the neck gives an expression of massive solidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, there were intervals of solitude when one heard, in these paths,
      only the buzz of flies, in the yellowed and finishing shade of the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho looked at them, at these rare passers-by who crossed his road,
      surprised at not meeting somebody he knew who would stop before him. But
      there were no familiar faces. And the friends whom he met were not
      effusive, there were only vague good-days exchanged with folks who turned
      round a little, with an impression of having seen him sometime, but not
      recalling when, and fell back into the humble dream of the fields.&mdash;And
      he felt more emphasized than ever the primary differences between him and
      those farm laborers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over there, however, comes one of those carts whose sheaf is so big that
      branches of oaks in its passage catch it. In front, walks the driver, with
      a look of soft resignation, a big, peaceful boy, red as the ferns, red as
      the autumn, with a reddish fur in a bush on his bare chest; he walks with
      a supple and nonchalant manner, his arms extended like those of a cross on
      his goad, placed across his shoulders. Thus, doubtless, on these same
      mountains, marched his ancestors, farm laborers and cowboys like him since
      numberless centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this one, at Ramuntcho's aspect, touches the forehead of his oxen,
      stops them with a gesture and a cry of command, then comes to the
      traveller, extending to him his brave hands.&mdash;Florentino! A
      Florentino much changed, having squarer shoulders, quite a man now, with
      an assured and fixed demeanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two friends embrace each other. Then, they scan each other's faces in
      silence, troubled suddenly by the wave of reminiscences which come from
      the depth of their minds and which neither the one nor the other knows how
      to express; Ramuntcho, not better than Florentino, for, if his language be
      infinitely better formed, the profoundness and the mystery of his thoughts
      are also much more unfathomable.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it oppresses them to conceive things which they are powerless to tell;
      then their embarrassed looks return absent-mindedly to the two beautiful,
      big oxen:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are mine, you know,&rdquo; says Florentino. &ldquo;I was married two years ago.&mdash;My
      wife works. And, by working&mdash;we are beginning to get along.&mdash;Oh!&rdquo;
       he adds, with naive pride, &ldquo;I have another pair of oxen like these at the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he ceases to talk, flushing suddenly under his sunburn, for he has
      the tact which comes from the heart, which the humblest possess often by
      nature, but which education never gives, even to the most refined people
      in the world: considering the desolate return of Ramuntcho, his broken
      destiny, his betrothed buried over there among the black nuns, his mother
      dying, Florentino is afraid to have been already too cruel in displaying
      too much his own happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the silence returned; they looked at each other for an instant with
      kind smiles, finding no words. Besides, between them, the abyss of
      different conceptions has grown deeper in these three years. And
      Florentino, touching anew the foreheads of his oxen, makes them march
      again with a call of his tongue, and presses tighter the hand of his
      friend:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see each other again, shall we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the noise of the cow-bells is soon lost in the calm of the road more
      shady, where begins to diminish the heat of the day&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he has succeeded in life, that one!&rdquo; thinks Ramuntcho lugubriously,
      continuing his walk under the autumn branches&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The road which he follows ascends, hollowed here and there by springs and
      sometimes crossed by big roots of oaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Etchezar will appear to him and, before seeing it, the image of it
      becomes more and more precise in him, recalled and enlivened in his memory
      by the aspect of the surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Empty now, all this land, where Gracieuse is no more, empty and sad as a
      beloved home where the great Reaper has passed!&mdash;And yet Ramuntcho,
      in the depths of his being, dares to think that, in some small convent
      over there, under the veil of a nun, the cherished black eyes still exist
      and that he will be able at least to see them; that taking the veil is not
      quite like dying, and that perhaps the last word of his destiny has not
      been said irrevocably.&mdash;For, when he reflects, what can have changed
      thus the soul of Gracieuse, formerly so uniquely devoted to him?&mdash;Oh,
      terrible, foreign pressure, surely&mdash;And then, when they come face to
      face again, who knows?&mdash;When they talk, with his eyes in her eyes?&mdash;But
      what can he expect that is reasonable and possible?&mdash;In his native
      land has a nun ever broken her eternal vows to follow one to whom she was
      engaged? And besides, where would they go to live together afterward, when
      folks would get out of their way, would fly from them as renegades?&mdash;To
      America perhaps, and even there!&mdash;And how could he take her from
      these white houses of the dead where the sisters live, eternally watched?&mdash;Oh,
      no, all this is a chimera which may not be realized&mdash;All is at an
      end, all is finished hopelessly&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the sadness which comes to him from Gracieuse is forgotten for a
      moment, and he feels nothing except an outburst of his heart toward his
      mother, toward his mother who remains to him, who is there, very near, a
      little upset, doubtless, by the joyful trouble of waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, on the left of his route, is a humble hamlet, half hidden in the
      beeches and the oaks, with its ancient chapel,&mdash;and with its wall for
      the pelota game, under very old trees, at the crossing of two paths. At
      once, in Ramuntcho's youthful head, the course of thoughts changes again:
      that little wall with rounded top, covered with wash of kalsomine and
      ochre, awakens tumultuously in him thoughts of life, of force and of joy;
      with a childish ardor he says to himself that to-morrow he will be able to
      return to that game of the Basques, which is an intoxication of movement
      and of rapid skill; he thinks of the grand matches on Sundays after
      vespers, of the glory of the fine struggles with the champions of Spain,
      of all this deprivation of his years of exile. But it is a very short
      instant, and mortal despair comes back to him: his triumphs on the
      squares, Gracieuse shall not see them; then, what is the use!&mdash;Without
      her, all things, even these, fall back discolored, useless and vain, do
      not even exist&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Etchezar!&mdash;Etchezar, is revealed suddenly at a turn of the road!&mdash;It
      is in a red light, something like a fantasmagoria image, illuminated
      purposely in a special manner in the midst of grand backgrounds of shade
      and of night. It is the hour of the setting sun. Around the isolated
      village, which the old, heavy belfry, surmounts, a last sheaf of rays
      traces a halo of the color of copper and gold, while clouds&mdash;and a
      gigantic obscurity emanating from the Gizune&mdash;darken the lands piled
      up above and under, the mass of brown hills, colored by the death of the
      ferns&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the melancholy apparition of the native land, to the soldier who
      returns and will not find his sweetheart&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years have passed since he left here.&mdash;Well, three years, at
      his age, are an abyss of time, a period which changes all things. And,
      after that lone exile, how this village, which he adores, appears to him
      diminished, small, walled in the mountains, sad and hidden!&mdash;In the
      depth of his mind of a tall, uncultured boy, commences again, to make him
      suffer more, the struggle of those two sentiments of a too refined man,
      which are an inheritance of his unknown father: an attachment almost
      maladive to the home, to the land of childhood, and a fear of returning to
      be enclosed in it, when there exist in the world other places so vast and
      so free. &mdash;After the warm afternoon, the autumn is indicated now by
      the hasty fall of the day, with a coolness ascending suddenly from the
      valleys underneath, a scent of dying leaves and of moss. And then the
      thousand details of preceding autumns in the Basque country, of the former
      Novembers, come to him very precisely; the cold fall of night succeeding
      the beautiful, sunlit day; the sad clouds appearing with the night; the
      Pyrenees confounded in vapors inky gray, or, in places, cut in black
      silhouettes on a pale, golden sky; around the houses, the belated flowers
      of the gardens, which the frost spares for a long time here, and, in front
      of all the doors, the strewn leaves of the plane-trees, the yellow strewn
      leaves cracking under the steps of the man returning in sandals to his
      home for supper.&mdash;Oh, the heedless joy of these returns to the home,
      in the nights of other times, after days of marching on the rude mountain!
      Oh, the gaiety, in that time, of the first winter fires&mdash;in the tall,
      smoky hearth ornamented with a drapery of white calico and with a strip of
      pink paper. No, in the city, with its rows of houses one does not have the
      real impression of returning home, of earthing up like plants at night in
      the primitive manner, as one has it here, under those Basque roofs,
      solitary in the midst of the country, with the grand, surrounding black,
      the grand, shivering black of the foliage, the grand, changing black of
      the clouds and the summits.&mdash;But to-day, his travels, his new
      conceptions, have diminished and spoiled his mountaineer's home; he will
      doubtless find it almost desolate, especially in the thought that his
      mother shall not be there always&mdash;and that Gracieuse shall never be
      there again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pace quickens in his haste to embrace his mother; he turns around his
      village instead of going into it, in order to reach his house through a
      path which overlooks the square and church; passing quickly, he looks at
      everything with inexpressible pain. Peace, silence soar over this little
      parish of Etchezar, heart of the French Basque land and country of all the
      famous pelotaris of the past who have become heavy grandfathers, or are
      dead now. The immutable church, where have remained buried his dreams of
      faith, is surrounded by the same dark cypresses, like a mosque. The
      ball-game square, while he walks quickly above it, is still lighted by the
      sun with a finishing ray, oblique, toward the background, toward the wall
      which the ancient inscription surmounts,&mdash;as on the evening of his
      first great success, four years ago, when, in the joyous crowd, Gracieuse
      stood in a blue gown, she who has become a black nun to-day.&mdash;On the
      deserted benches, on the granite steps where the grass grows, three or
      four old men are seated, who were formerly the heroes of the place and
      whom their reminiscences bring back here incessantly, to talk at the end
      of the days, when the twilight descends from the summits, invades the
      earth, seems to emanate and to fall from the brown Pyrenees.&mdash;Oh, the
      folks who live here, whose lives run here; oh, the little cider inns, the
      little, simple shops and the old, little things&mdash;brought from the
      cities, from the other places&mdash;sold to the mountaineers of the
      surrounding country!&mdash;How all this seems to him now strange,
      separated from him, or set far in the background of the primitive past!&mdash;Is
      he truly not a man of Etchezar to-day, is he no longer the Ramuntcho of
      former times?&mdash;What particular thing resides in his mind to prevent
      him from feeling comfortable here, as the others feel? Why is it
      prohibited to him, to him alone, to accomplish here the tranquil destiny
      of his dreams, since all his friends have accomplished theirs?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last here is his house, there, before his eyes. It is as he expected to
      find it. As he expected, he recognizes along the wall all the persistent
      flowers cultivated by his mother, the same flowers which the frost has
      destroyed weeks ago in the North from which he comes: heliotropes,
      geraniums, tall dahlias and roses with climbing branches. And the
      cherished, strewn leaves, which fall every autumn from the vault-shaped
      plane-trees, are there also, and are crushed with a noise so familiar
      under his steps&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lower hall, when he enters, there is already grayish indecision,
      already night. The high chimney, where his glance rests at first by an
      instinctive reminiscence of the fires of ancient evenings, stands the same
      with its white drapery; but cold, filled with shade, smelling of absence
      or death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He runs up to his mother's room. She, from her bed having recognized her
      son's step, has straightened up, all stiff, all white in the twilight:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ramuntcho,&rdquo; she says, in a veiled and aged voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She extends her arms to him and as soon as she holds him, enlaces and
      embraces him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ramuntcho!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, having uttered this name without adding anything, she leans her head
      against his cheek, in the habitual movement of surrender, in the movement
      of the grand, tender feelings of other times.&mdash;He, then, perceives
      that his mother's face is burning against his. Through her shirt he feels
      the arms that surround him thin, feverish and hot. And for the first time,
      he is frightened; the notion that she is doubtless very ill comes to his
      mind, the possibility and the sudden terror that she might die&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are alone, mother! But who takes care of you? Who watches over
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who watches over me?&mdash;&rdquo; she replies with her abrupt brusqueness, her
      ideas of a peasant suddenly returned. &ldquo;Spending money to nurse me, why
      should I do it?&mdash;The church woman or the old Doyamburu comes in the
      day-time to give me the things that I need, the things that the physician
      orders.&mdash;But&mdash;medicine!&mdash;Well! Light a lamp, my Ramuntcho!&mdash;I
      want to see you&mdash;and I cannot see you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, when the clearness has come from a Spanish, smuggled match, she says
      in a tone of caress infinitely sweet, as one talks to a very little child
      whom one adores:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your mustache! The long mustache which has come to you, my son!&mdash;I
      do not recognize my Ramuntcho!&mdash;Bring your lamp here, bring it here
      so that I can look at you!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He also sees her better now, under the new light of that lamp, while she
      admires him lovingly. And he is more frightened still, because the cheeks
      of his mother are so hollow, her hair is so whitened; even the expression
      of her eyes is changed and almost extinguished; on her face appears the
      sinister and irremediable labor of time, of suffering and of death&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, now, two tears, rapid and heavy, fall from the eyes of Franchita,
      which widen, become living again, made young by desperate revolt and
      hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that woman,&rdquo; she says suddenly. &ldquo;Oh, that Dolores!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her cry expresses and summarizes all her jealousy of thirty years'
      standing, all her merciless rancor against that enemy of her childhood who
      has succeeded at last in breaking the life of her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence between them. He is seated, with head bent, near the bed,
      holding the poor, feverish hand which his mother has extended to him. She,
      breathing more quickly, seems for a long while under the oppression of
      something which she hesitates to express:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, my Ramuntcho!&mdash;I would like to ask you.&mdash;What do you
      intend to do, my son? What are your projects for the future?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, mother.&mdash;I will think, I will see.&mdash;You ask&mdash;all
      at once.&mdash;We have time to talk of this, have we not?&mdash;To
      America, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she says slowly, with the fear that was in her for days, &ldquo;to
      America&mdash;I suspected it. Oh, that is what you will do.&mdash;I knew
      it, I knew it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her phrase ends in a groan and she joins her hands to try to pray&mdash;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho, the next morning, was wandering in the village, under a sun
      which had pierced the clouds of the night, a sun as radiant as that of
      yesterday. Careful in his dress, the ends of his mustache turned up, proud
      in his demeanor, elegant, grave and handsome, he went at random, to see
      and to be seen, a little childishness mingling with his seriousness, a
      little pleasure with his distress. His mother had said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am better, I assure you. To-day is Sunday; go, walk about I pray you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And passers-by turned their heads to look at him, whispered the news:
      &ldquo;Franchita's son has returned home; he looks very well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A summer illusion persisted everywhere, with, however, the unfathomable
      melancholy of things tranquilly finishing. Under that impassible radiance
      of sunlight, the Pyrenean fields seemed dull, all their plants, all their
      grasses were as if collected in one knows not what resignation weary of
      living, what expectation of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turns of the path, the houses, the least trees, all recalled hours of
      other times to Ramuntcho, hours wherein Gracieuse was mingled. And then,
      at each reminiscence, at each step, engraved itself and hammered itself in
      his mind, under a new form, this verdict without recourse: &ldquo;It is
      finished, you are alone forever, Gracieuse has been taken away from you
      and is in prison&mdash;&rdquo; The rents in his heart, every accident in the
      path renewed and changed them. And, in the depth of his being, as a
      constant basis for his reflections, this other anxiety endured: his
      mother, his mother very ill, in mortal danger, perhaps&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      He met people who stopped him, with a kind and welcoming air, who talked
      to him in the dear Basque tongue&mdash;ever alert and sonorous despite its
      incalculable antiquity; old Basque caps, old white heads, liked to talk of
      the ball-game to this fine player returned to his cradle. And then, at
      once, after the first words of greeting, smiles went out, in spite of this
      clear sun in this blue sky, and all were disturbed by the thought of
      Gracieuse in a veil and of Franchita dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      A violent flush of blood went up to his face when he caught sight of
      Dolores, at a distance, going into her home. Very decrepit, that one, and
      wearing a prostrate air! She had recognized him, for she turned quickly
      her obstinate and hard head, covered by a mourning mantilla. With a
      sentiment of pity at seeing her so undone, he reflected that she had
      struck herself with the same blow, and that she would be alone now in her
      old age and at her death&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the square, he met Marcos Iragola who informed him that he was married,
      like Florentino&mdash;and with the little friend of his childhood, he
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not have to serve in the army,&rdquo; Iragola explained, &ldquo;because we are
      Guipuzcoans, immigrants in France; so I could marry her earlier!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He, twenty-one years old; she eighteen; without lands and without a penny,
      Marcos and Pilar, but joyfully associated all the same, like two sparrows
      building their nest. And the very young husband added laughingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you? Father said: 'As long as you do not marry I warn you that
      I shall give you a little brother every year.' And he would have done it!
      There are already fourteen of us, all living&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how simple and natural they are! How wise and humbly happy!&mdash;Ramuntcho
      quitted him with some haste, with a heart more bruised for having spoken
      to him, but wishing very sincerely that he should be happy in his
      improvident, birdlike, little home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there, folks were seated in front of their doors, in that sort of
      atrium of branches which precedes all the houses of this country. And
      their vaults of plane-trees, cut in the Basque fashion, which in the
      summer are so impenetrable all open worked in this season, let fall on
      them sheafs of light. The sun flamed, somewhat destructive and sad, above
      those yellow leaves which were drying up&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ramuntcho, in his slow promenade, felt more and more what intimate
      ties, singularly persistent, would attach him always to this region of the
      earth, harsh and enclosed, even if he were there alone, abandoned, without
      friends, without a wife and without a mother&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the high mass rings! And the vibrations of that bell impress him with
      a strange emotion that he did not expect. Formerly, its familiar appeal
      was an appeal to joy and to pleasure&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stops, he hesitates, in spite of his actual religious unbelief and in
      spite of his grudge against that church which has taken his betrothed away
      from him. The bell seems to invite him to-day in so special a manner, with
      so peaceful and caressing a voice: &ldquo;Come, come; let yourself be rocked as
      your ancestors were; come, poor, desolate being, let yourself be caught by
      the lure which will make your tears fall without bitterness, and will help
      you to die&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Undecided, resisting still, he walks, however, toward the church&mdash;when
      Arrochkoa appears!
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrochkoa, whose catlike mustache has lengthened a great deal and whose
      feline expression is accentuated, runs to him with extended hands, with an
      effusion that he did not expect, in an enthusiasm, perhaps sincere, for
      that ex-sergeant who has such a grand air, who wears the ribbon of a medal
      and whose adventures have made a stir in the land:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my Ramuntcho, when did you arrive?&mdash;Oh, if I could have
      prevented&mdash;What do you think of my old, hardened mother and of all
      those church bigots?&mdash;Oh, I did not tell you: I have a son, since two
      months; a fine little fellow! We have so many things to say, my poor
      friend, so many things!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bell rings, rings, fills the air more and more with its soft appeal,
      very grave and somewhat imposing also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going there, I suppose?&rdquo; asks Arrochkoa, pointing to the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, oh, no,&rdquo; replies Ramuntcho, sombrely decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well come then, let us go in here and taste the new cider of your
      country!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the smugglers' cider mill, he brings him; both, near the open window,
      sit as formerly, looking outside;&mdash;and this place also, these old
      benches, these casks in a line in the back, these same images on the wall,
      are there to recall to Ramuntcho the delicious times of the past, the
      times that are finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather is adorably beautiful; the sky retains a rare limpidity;
      through the air passes that special scent of falling seasons, scent of
      woods despoiled, of dead leaves that the sun overheats on the soil. Now,
      after the absolute calm of the morning, rises a wind of autumn, a chill of
      November, announcing clearly, but with a melancholy almost charming, that
      the winter is near&mdash;a southern winter, it is true, a softened winter,
      hardly interrupting the life of the country. The gardens and all the old
      walls are still ornamented with roses&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      At first they talk of indifferent things while drinking their cider, of
      Ramuntcho's travels, of what happened in the country during his absence,
      of the marriages which occurred or were broken. And, to those two rebels
      who have fled from the church, all the sounds of the mass come during
      their talk, the sounds of the small bells and the sounds of the organ, the
      ancient songs that fill the high, sonorous nave&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Arrochkoa returns to the burning subject:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you had been here it would not have occurred!&mdash;And even now,
      if she saw you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho looks at him then, trembling at what he imagines he understands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even now?&mdash;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, women&mdash;with them, does one ever know?&mdash;She cared a great
      deal for you and it was hard for her.&mdash;In these days there is no law
      to keep her there!&mdash;How little would I care if she broke her vows&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho turns his head, lowers his eyes, says nothing, strikes the soil
      with his foot. And, in the silence, the impious thing which he had hardly
      dared to formulate to himself, seems to him little by little less
      chimerical, attainable, almost easy.&mdash;No, it is not impossible to
      regain her. And, if need be, doubtless, Arrochkoa, her own brother, would
      lend a hand. Oh, what a temptation and what a new disturbance in his mind&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Drily he asks, &ldquo;Where is she?&mdash;Far from here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far enough, yes. Over there, toward Navarre, five or six hours of a
      carriage drive. They have changed her convent twice. She lives at
      Amezqueta now, beyond the oak forests of Oyanzabal; the road is through
      Mendichoco; you know, we must have gone through it together one night with
      Itchoua.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The high mass is ended.&mdash;Groups pass: women, pretty girls, elegant in
      demeanor, among whom Gracieuse is no more: many Basque caps lowered on
      sunburnt foreheads. And all these faces turn to look at the two cider
      drinkers at their window. The wind, that blows stronger, makes dance
      around their glasses large, dead, plane-tree leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman, already old, casts at them, from under her black cloth mantilla,
      a sad and evil glance:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says Arrochkoa, &ldquo;here is mother! And she looks at us crosswise.&mdash;She
      may flatter herself for her work!&mdash;She punished herself for she will
      end in solitude now.&mdash;Catherine&mdash;who is at Elsagarray's, you
      know&mdash;works by the day for her; otherwise, she would have nobody to
      talk to in the evening&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A bass voice, behind them, interrupts them, with a Basque greeting, hollow
      like a sound in a cavern, while a large and heavy hand rests on
      Ramuntcho's shoulder as if to take possession of him: Itchoua, Itchoua who
      has just finished chanting his liturgy!&mdash;Not changed at all, this
      one; he has always his same ageless face, always his colorless mask which
      is at once that of a monk and that of a highwayman, and his same eyes, set
      in, hidden, absent. His mind also must have remained similar, his mind
      capable of impassible murder at the same time as devout fetichism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he says, in a tone which wishes to be that of a good fellow, &ldquo;you
      have returned to us, my Ramuntcho! Then we are going to work together, eh?
      Business is brisk with Spain now, you know, and arms are needed at the
      frontier. You are one of us, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replies Ramuntcho. &ldquo;We may talk of it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For several moments his departure for America has become a faint idea in
      his mind.&mdash;No!&mdash;He would rather stay in his native land, begin
      again his former life, reflect and wait obstinately. Anyway, now that he
      knows where she is, that village of Amezqueta, at a distance of five or
      six hours from here, haunts him in a dangerous way, and he hugs all sorts
      of sacrilegious projects which, until to-day, he would never have dared
      hardly to conceive.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      At noon, he returned to his isolated house to see his mother.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The febrile and somewhat artificial improvement of the morning had
      continued. Nursed by the old Doyanburu, Franchita said that she felt
      better, and, in the fear that Ramuntcho might become dreamy, she made him
      return to the square to attend the Sunday ball-game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breath of the wind became warm again, blew from the south; none of the
      shivers of a moment ago remained; on the contrary, a summer sun and
      atmosphere, on the reddened woods, on the rusty ferns, on the roads where
      continued to fall the sad leaves. But the sky was gathering thick clouds,
      which suddenly came out from the rear of the mountains as if they had
      stayed there in ambush to appear all at the same signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ball-game had not yet been arranged and groups were disputing
      violently when he reached the square. Quickly, he was surrounded, he was
      welcomed, designated by acclamation to go into the game and sustain the
      honor of his county. He did not dare, not having played for three years
      and distrusting his unaccustomed arm. At last, he yielded and began to
      undress&mdash;but to whom would he trust his waistcoat now?&mdash;The
      image reappeared to him, suddenly, of Gracieuse, seated on the nearest
      steps and extending her hands to receive it. To whom would he throw his
      waistcoat to-day? It is intrusted ordinarily to some friend, as the
      toreadors do with their gilt silk mantles.&mdash;He threw it at random,
      this time, anywhere, on the granite of the old benches flowered with
      belated scabwort&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The match began. Out of practice at first, uncertain, he missed several
      times the little bounding thing which is to be caught in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, he went to his work with a rage, regained his former ease and became
      himself again superbly. His muscles had gained in strength what they had
      perhaps lost in skill; again he was applauded, he knew the physical
      intoxication of moving, of leaping, of feeling his muscles play like
      supple and violent springs, of hearing around him the ardent murmur of the
      crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then came the instant of rest which interrupts ordinarily the long
      disputed games; the moment when one sits halting, the blood in ebulition,
      the hands reddened, trembling,&mdash;and when one regains the course of
      ideas which the game suppresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, he realized the distress of being alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the assembled heads, above the woolen caps and the hair ornamented
      with kerchiefs, was accentuated that stormy sky which the southern winds,
      when they are about to finish, bring always. The air had assumed an
      absolute limpidity, as if it had become rarified, rarified unto emptiness.
      The mountains seemed to have advanced extraordinarily; the Pyrenees were
      crushing the village; the Spanish summits or the French summits were
      there, all equally near, as if pasted on one another, exaggerating their
      burned, brown colors, their intense and sombre, violet tints. Large
      clouds, which seemed as solid as terrestrial things, were displayed in the
      form of bows, veiling the sun, casting an obscurity which was like an
      eclipse. And here and there, through some rent, bordered with dazzling
      silver, one could see the profound blue green of a sky almost African. All
      this country, the unstable climate of which changes between a morning and
      an evening, became for several hours strangely southern in aspect, in
      temperature and in light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho breathed that dry and suave air, come from the South in order to
      vivify the lungs. It was the true weather of his native land. It was even
      the characteristic weather of that land of the Bay of Biscay, the weather
      which he liked best formerly, and which to-day filled him with physical
      comfort&mdash;as much as with disturbance of mind, for all that was
      preparing, all that was amassing above, with airs of ferocious menace,
      impressed him with the sentiment of a heaven deaf to prayers, without
      thoughts as without master, a simple focus of storms, of blind forces
      creating, recreating and destroying. And, during these minutes of halting
      meditation, where men in Basque caps of a temperament other than his,
      surrounded him to congratulate him, he made no reply, he did not listen,
      he felt only the ephemeral plenitude of his own vigor, of his youth, of
      his will, and he said to himself that he wished to use harshly and
      desperately all things, to try anything, without the obstacle of vain
      fears, of vain church scruples, in order to take back the young girl whom
      his soul and his flesh desired, who was the unique one and the betrothed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the game had ended gloriously for him, he returned alone, sad and
      resolute,&mdash;proud of having won, of having known how to preserve his
      agile skilfulness, and realizing that it was a means in life, a source of
      money and of strength, to have remained one of the chief ball-players of
      the Basque country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the black sky, there were still the same tints exaggerated by
      everything, the same sombre horizon. And still the same breaths from the
      south, dry and warm, agitors of muscles and of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the clouds had descended, descended, and soon this weather, these
      appearances would change and finish. He knew it, as do all the countrymen
      accustomed to look at the sky: it was only the announcement of an autumn
      squall to close the series of lukewarm winds,&mdash;of a decisive shake-up
      to finish despoiling the woods of their leaves. Immediately after would
      come the long showers, chilling everything, the mists making the mountains
      confused and distant. And it would be the dull rain of winter, stopping
      the saps, making temporary projects languid, extinguishing ardor and
      revolt&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the first drops of water were beginning to fall on the road, separate
      and heavy on the strewn leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day before, when he returned home, at twilight, his mother was
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her asleep, in a bad sleep, agitated, burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rambling in his house he tried, in order to make it less sinister, to
      light in the large, lower chimney a fire of branches, but it went out
      smoking. Outside, torrents of rain fell. Through the windows, as through
      gray shrouds, the village hardly appeared, effaced under a winter squall.
      The wind and the rain whipped the walls of the isolated house, around
      which, once more, would thicken the grand blackness of the country in
      rainy nights&mdash;that grand blackness, that grand silence, to which he
      had long been unaccustomed. And in his childish heart, came little by
      little, a cold of solitude and of abandonment; he lost even his energy,
      the consciousness of his love, of his strength and of his youth; he felt
      vanishing, before the misty evening, all his projects of struggle and of
      resistance. The future which he had formed a moment ago became miserable
      or chimerical in his eyes, that future of a pelota player, of a poor
      amuser of the crowds, at the mercy of a malady or of a moment of weakness&mdash;His
      hopes of the day-time were going out, based, doubtless, on unstable
      things, fleeing now in the night&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he felt transported, as in his childhood, toward that soft refuge
      which was his mother; he went up, on tiptoe, to see her, even asleep, and
      to remain there, near her bed, while she slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, when he had lighted in the room, far from her, a discreet lamp, she
      appeared to him more changed than she had been by the fever of yesterday;
      the possibility presented itself, more frightful to his mind, of losing
      her, of being alone, of never feeling again on his cheek the caress of her
      head.&mdash;Moreover, for the first time, she seemed old to him, and, in
      the memory of all the deceptions which she had suffered because of him, he
      felt a pity for her, a tender and infinite pity, at sight of her wrinkles
      which he had not before observed, of her hair recently whitened at the
      temples. Oh, a desolate pity and hopeless, with the conviction that it was
      too late now to arrange life better.&mdash;And something painful, against
      which there was no possible resistance, shook his chest, contracted his
      young face; objects became confused to his view, and, in the need of
      imploring, of asking for mercy, he let himself fall on his knees, his
      forehead on his mother's bed, weeping at last, weeping hot tears&mdash;

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whom did you see in the village, my son?&rdquo; she asked, the next morning
      during the improvement which returned every time, in the first hours of
      the day, after the fever had subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whom did you see in the village, my son?&mdash;&rdquo; In talking, she
      tried to retain an air of gaiety, of saying indifferent things, in the
      fear of attacking grave subjects and of provoking disquieting replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Arrochkoa, mother,&rdquo; he replied, in a tone which brought back
      suddenly the burning questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrochkoa!&mdash;And how did he behave with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he talked to me as if I had been his brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, I know.&mdash;Oh, it was not he who made her do it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said even&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not dare to continue now, and he lowered his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said what, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&mdash;that it was hard to put her in prison there&mdash;that
      perhaps&mdash;that, even now, if she saw me, he was not far from thinking&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She straightened under the shock of what she had just suspected; with her
      thin hands she parted her hair, newly whitened, and her eyes became again
      young and sharp, in an expression almost wicked from joy, from avenged
      pride:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that, he!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you forgive me, mother&mdash;if I tried?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took his two hands and they remained silent, not daring, with their
      scruples as Catholics, to utter the sacrilegious thing which was fomenting
      in their heads. In the depth of her eyes, the evil spark went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive you?&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;you know very well
      that I would.&mdash;But do not do this, my son, I pray you, do not do it;
      it would bring misfortune to both of you!&mdash;Do not think of it, my
      Ramuntcho, never think of it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, they hushed, hearing the steps of the physician who was coming up
      for his daily visit. And it was the only time, the supreme time when they
      were to talk of it in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ramuntcho knew now that, even after death, she would not condemn him
      for having attempted, or for having committed it: and this pardon was
      sufficient for him, and, now that he felt sure of obtaining it, the
      greatest barrier, between his sweetheart and him, had now suddenly fallen.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the evening, when the fever returned, she seemed already much more
      dangerously affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her robust body, the malady had violently taken hold,&mdash;the malady
      recognized too late, and insufficiently nursed because of her stubbornness
      as a peasant, because of her incredulous disdain for physicians and
      medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And little by little, in Ramuntcho, the frightful thought of losing her
      installed itself in a dominant place; during the hours of watchfulness
      spent near her bed, silent and alone, he was beginning to face the reality
      of that separation, the horror of that death and of that burial,&mdash;even
      all the lugubrious morrows, all the aspects of his future life: the house
      which he would have to sell before quitting the country; then, perhaps,
      the desperate attempt at the convent of Amezqueta; then the departure,
      probably solitary and without desire to return, for unknown America&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea also of the great secret which she would carry with her forever,&mdash;of
      the secret of his birth,&mdash;tormented him more from hour to hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, bending over her, and, trembling, as if he were about to commit an
      impious thing in a church, he dared to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&mdash;Mother, tell me now who my father is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered at first under the supreme question, realizing well, that if
      he dared to question her thus, it was because she was lost. Then, she
      hesitated for a moment: in her head, boiling from fever, there was a
      battle; her duty, she discerned well no longer; her obstinacy which had
      lasted for so many years faltered almost at this hour, in presence of the
      sudden apparition of death&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, resolved at last forever, she replied at once, in the brusque tone of
      her bad days:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father!&mdash;And what is the use, my son?&mdash;What do you want of
      your father who for twenty years has never thought of you?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, it was decided, ended, she would not tell. Anyway, it was too late
      now; at the moment when she would disappear, enter into the inert
      powerlessness of the dead, how could she risk changing so completely the
      life of that son over whom she would no longer watch, how could she
      surrender him to his father, who perhaps would make of him a disbeliever
      and a disenchanted man like himself! What a responsibility and what an
      immense terror&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her decision having been taken irrevocably, she thought of herself,
      feeling for the first time that life was closing behind her, and joined
      her hands for a sombre prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Ramuntcho, after this attempt to learn, after this great effort
      which had almost seemed a profanation to him, he bent his head before his
      mother's will and questioned no longer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It went very quickly now, with the drying fevers that made her cheeks red,
      her nostrils pinched, or with the exhaustion of baths of perspiration, her
      pulse hardly beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ramuntcho had no other thought than his mother; the image of Gracieuse
      ceased to visit him during these funereal days.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was going, Franchita; she was going, mute and as if indifferent,
      asking for nothing, never complaining&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, however, as he was watching, she called him suddenly with a poor
      voice of anguish, to throw her arms around him, to draw him to her, lean
      her head on his cheek. And, in that minute, Ramuntcho saw pass in her eyes
      the great Terror&mdash;that of the flesh which feels that it is finishing,
      that of the men and that of the beasts, the horrible and the same for all.&mdash;A
      believer, she was that a little; practising rather, like so many other
      women around her; timid in the face of dogmas, of observances, of
      services, but without a clear conception of the world beyond, without a
      luminous hope.&mdash;Heaven, all the beautiful things promised after life.&mdash;Yes,
      perhaps.&mdash;But still, the black hole was there, near and certain,
      where she would have to turn into dust.&mdash;What was sure, what was
      inexorable, was the fact that never, never more would her destroyed visage
      lean in a real manner on that of Ramuntcho; then, in the doubt of having a
      mind which would fly, in the horror and the misery of annihilation, of
      becoming powder and nothing, she wanted again kisses from that son, and
      she clutched at him as clutch the wrecked who fall into the black and deep
      waters&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood all this, which the poor, fading eyes said so well. And the
      pity so tender, which he had already felt at seeing the wrinkles and the
      white hairs of his mother, overflowed like a flood from his very young
      heart; he responded to this appeal with all that one may give of desolate
      clasps and embraces.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it did not last long. She had never been one of those who are
      enervated for long, or at least, let it appear. Her arms unclasped, her
      head fallen back, she closed her eyes again, unconscious now,&mdash;or
      stoical&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ramuntcho, standing, not daring to touch her, wept heavy tears,
      without noise, turning his head,&mdash;while, in the distance, the parish
      bell began to ring the curfew, sang the tranquil peace of the village,
      filled the air with vibrations soft, protective, advising sound sleep to
      those who have morrows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning, after having confessed, she passed out of life,
      silent and haughty, having felt a sort of shame for her suffering,&mdash;while
      the same bell rang slowly her agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at night, Ramuntcho found himself alone, beside that thing in bed and
      cold, which is preserved and looked at for several hours, but which one
      must make haste to bury in the earth&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Eight days after.
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the fall of night, while a bad mountain squall twisted the branches of
      the trees, Ramuntcho entered his deserted house where the gray of death
      seemed scattered everywhere. A little of winter had passed over the Basque
      land, a little frost, burning the annual flowers, ending the illusory
      summer of December. In front of Franchita's door, the geraniums, the
      dahlias had just died, and the path which led to the house, which no one
      cared for, disappeared under the mass of yellow leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Ramuntcho, this first week of mourning had been occupied by the
      thousand details that rock sorrow. Proud also, he had desired that all
      should be done in a luxurious manner, according to the old usages of the
      parish. His mother had been buried in a coffin of black velvet ornamented
      with silver nails. Then, there had been mortuary masses, attended by the
      neighbors in long capes, the women enveloped and hooded with black. And
      all this represented a great deal of expense for him, who was poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the sum given formerly, at the time of his birth, by his unknown
      father, little remained, the greater part having been lost through
      unfaithful bankers. And now, he would have to quit the house, sell the
      dear familiar furniture, realize the most money possible for the flight to
      America&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, he returned home peculiarly disturbed, because he was to do a
      thing, postponed from day to day, about which his conscience was not at
      rest. He had already examined, picked out, all that belonged to his
      mother; but the box containing her papers and her letters was still intact&mdash;and
      to-night he would open it, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not sure that death, as many persons think, gives the right to
      those who remain to read letters, to penetrate the secrets of those who
      have just gone. To burn without looking seemed to him more respectful,
      more honest. But it was also to destroy forever the means of discovering
      the one whose abandoned son he was.&mdash;Then what should he do?&mdash;And
      from whom could he take advice, since he had no one in the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the large chimney he lit the evening fire: then he got from an upper
      room the disquieting box, placed it on a table near the fire, beside his
      lamp, and sat down to reflect again. In the face of these papers, almost
      sacred, almost prohibited, which he would touch and which death alone
      could have placed in his hands, he had in this moment the consciousness,
      in a more heartbreaking manner, of the irrevocable departure of his
      mother; tears returned to him and he wept there, alone, in the silence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he opened the box&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      His arteries beat heavily. Under the surrounding trees, in the obscure
      solitude, he felt that forms were moving, to look at him through the
      window-panes. He felt breaths strange to his own chest, as if some one was
      breathing behind him. Shades assembled, interested in what he was about to
      do.&mdash;The house was crowded with phantoms&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were letters, preserved there for more than twenty years, all in the
      same handwriting,&mdash;one of those handwritings, at once negligent and
      easy, which men of the world have and which, in the eyes of the simple
      minded, are an indication of great social difference. And at first, a
      vague dream of protection, of elevation and of wealth diverted the course
      of his thoughts.&mdash;He had no doubt about the hand which had written
      them, those letters, and he held them tremblingly, not daring to read
      them, nor even to look at the name with which they were signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One only had retained its envelope; then he read the address: &ldquo;To Madame
      Franchita Duval.&rdquo;&mdash;Oh! yes, he remembered having heard that his
      mother, at the time of her disappearance from the Basque country, had
      taken that name for a while.&mdash;Following this, was an indication of
      street and number, which it pained him to read without his being able to
      understand why, which made the blood come to his cheeks; then the name of
      that large city, wherein he was born.&mdash;With fixed eyes, he stayed
      there, looking no longer.&mdash;And suddenly, he had the horrible vision
      of that clandestine establishment: in a suburban apartment, his mother,
      young, elegant, mistress of some rich idler, or of some officer perhaps!&mdash;In
      the regiment he had known some of these establishments, which doubtless
      are all alike, and he had found in them for himself unexpected adventures.&mdash;A
      dizziness seized him, to catch a glimpse thus under a new aspect of the
      one whom he had venerated so much; the dear past faltered behind him, as
      if to fall into a desolating abyss. And his despair turned into a sudden
      execration for the one who had given life to him through a caprice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! to burn them, to burn them as quickly as possible, these letters of
      misfortune!&mdash;And he began to throw them one by one into the fire,
      where they were consumed by sudden flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      A photograph, however, came out of them, fell on the floor; then he could
      not refrain from taking it to the lamp to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his impression was heart-rending, during the few seconds when his eyes
      met the half effaced ones of the yellowed image!&mdash;It resembled him!&mdash;He
      found, with profound fear, something of himself in the unknown. And
      instinctively he turned round, asking himself if the spectres in the
      obscure corners had not come near behind him to look also.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had hardly an appreciable duration, that silent interview, unique and
      supreme, with his father. To the fire also, the image! He threw it, with a
      gesture of anger and of terror, among the ashes of the last letters, and
      all left soon only a little mass of black dust, extinguishing the clear
      flames of the branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finished! The box was empty. He threw on the floor his cap which gave him
      a headache, and straightened himself, with perspiration on his forehead
      and a buzzing at the temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finished! Annihilated, all these memories of sin and of shame. And now the
      things of life appeared to him to regain their former balance; he regained
      his soft veneration for his mother, whose memory it seemed to him he had
      purified, avenged also a little, by this disdainful execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, his destiny had been fixed to-night forever. He would remain
      the Ramuntcho of other times, the &ldquo;son of Franchita,&rdquo; player of pelota and
      smuggler, free, freed from everything, owing nothing to and asking nothing
      from anybody. And he felt serene, without remorse, without fright, either,
      in this mortuary house, from which the shades had just disappeared,
      peaceful now and friendly&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the frontier, in a mountain hamlet. A black night, about one o'clock in
      the morning; a winter night inundated by cold and heavy rain. At the front
      of a sinister house which casts no light outside, Ramuntcho loads his
      shoulders with a heavy smuggled box, under the rippling rain, in the midst
      of a tomb-like obscurity. Itchoua's voice commands secretly,&mdash;as if
      one hardly touched with a bow the last strings of a bass viol,&mdash;and
      around him, in the absolute darkness, one divines the presence of other
      smugglers similarly loaded, ready to start on an adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now more than ever Ramuntcho's life, to run almost every night,
      especially on the cloudless and moonless nights when one sees nothing,
      when the Pyrenees are an immense chaos of shade. Amassing as much money as
      he can for his flight, he is in all the smuggling expeditions, as well in
      those that bring a suitable remuneration as in those where one risks death
      for a hundred cents. And ordinarily, Arrochkoa accompanies him, without
      necessity, in sport and for a whim.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have become inseparable, Arrochkoa, Ramuntcho,&mdash;and they talk
      freely of their projects about Gracieuse, Arrochkoa seduced especially by
      the attraction of some fine prowess, by the joy of taking a nun away from
      the church, of undoing the plans of his old, hardened mother,&mdash;and
      Ramuntcho, in spite of his Christian scruples which affect him still,
      making of this dangerous project his only hope, his only reason for being
      and for acting. For a month, almost, the attempt has been decided upon in
      theory and, in their long talks in the December nights, on the roads where
      they walk, or in the corners of the village cider mills where they sit
      apart, the means of execution are discussed by them, as if the question
      was a simple frontier undertaking. They must act very quickly, concludes
      Arrochkoa always, they must act in the surprise of a first interview which
      shall be for Gracieuse a very disturbing thing; they must act without
      giving her time to think or to recant, they must try something like
      kidnapping&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;what is that little convent of Amezqueta where
      they have placed her: four old, good sisters with her, in an isolated
      house!&mdash;I have my horse, you know, who gallops so quickly; once the
      nun is in a carriage with you, who can catch her?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And to-night they have resolved to take into their confidence Itchoua
      himself, a man accustomed to suspicious adventures, valuable in assaults
      at night, and who, for money, is capable of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place from which they start this time for the habitual smuggling
      expedition is named Landachkoa, and it is situated in France at ten
      minutes' distance from Spain. The inn, solitary and old, assumes as soon
      as the night falls, the air of a den of thieves; at this moment while the
      smugglers come out of one door, it is full of Spanish carbineers who have
      familiarly crossed the frontier to divert themselves here and who drink
      while singing. And the hostess, accustomed to these nocturnal affairs, has
      said joyfully, a moment ago, in Basque tongue to Itchoua's folks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all right! They are all drunk, you can go out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Go out! It is easier to advise than to do! You are drenched at the first
      steps and your feet slip on the mud, despite the aid of your sticks, on
      the stiff slopes of the paths. They do not see one another; they see
      nothing, neither the walls of the hamlet along which they pass nor the
      trees afterward, nor the rocks; they are like blind men, groping and
      slipping under a deluge, with the music of rain in their ears which makes
      them deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ramuntcho, who makes this trip for the first time, has no idea of the
      passages which they are to go through, strikes here and there his load
      against black things which are branches of beeches, or slips with his two
      feet, falters, straightens up, catches himself by planting at random his
      iron-pointed stick in the soil. They are the last on the march, Arrochkoa
      and Ramuntcho, following the band by ear;&mdash;and those who precede them
      make no more noise with their sandals than wolves in a forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all, fifteen smugglers on a distance of fifty metres, in the thick
      black of the mountain, under the incessant sprinkling of the shower; they
      carry boxes full of jewels, of watches, of chains, of rosaries, or bundles
      of Lyons silk, wrapped in oilcloth; in front, loaded with merchandise less
      valuable, walk two men who are the skirmishers, those who will attract, if
      necessary, the guns of the Spaniards and will then take flight, throwing
      away everything. All talk in a low voice, despite the drumming of the rain
      which already stifles sounds&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The one who precedes Ramuntcho turns round to warn him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a torrent in front of us&mdash;&rdquo; (Its presence would have been
      guessed by its noise louder than that of the rain&mdash;) &ldquo;We must cross
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;Cross it how? Wade in the water?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the water is too deep. Follow us. There is a tree trunk over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Groping, Ramuntcho finds that tree trunk, wet, slippery and round. He
      stands, advancing on this monkey's bridge in a forest, carrying his heavy
      load, while under him the invisible torrent roars. And he crosses, none
      knows how, in the midst of this intensity of black and of this noise of
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other shore they have to increase precaution and silence. There are
      no more mountain paths, frightful descents, under the night, more
      oppressing, of the woods. They have reached a sort of plain wherein the
      feet penetrate; the sandals attached to nervous legs cause a noise of
      beaten water. The eyes of the smugglers, their cat-like eyes, more and
      more dilated by the obscurity, perceive confusedly that there is free
      space around, that there is no longer the closing in of branches. They
      breathe better also and walk with a more regular pace that rests them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the bark of dogs immobilizes them all in a sudden manner, as if
      petrified under the shower. For a quarter of an hour they wait, without
      talking or moving; on their chests, the perspiration runs, mingled with
      the rain that enters by their shirt collars and falls to their belts.
    </p>
    <p>
      By dint of listening, they hear the buzz of their ears, the beat of their
      own arteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this tension of their senses is, in their trade, what they all like;
      it gives to them a sort of joy almost animal, it doubles the life of the
      muscles in them, who are beings of the past; it is a recall of the most
      primitive human impressions in the forests or the jungles of original
      epochs.&mdash;Centuries of civilization will be necessary to abolish this
      taste for dangerous surprises which impels certain children to play hide
      and seek, certain men to lie in ambush, to skirmish in wars, or to smuggle&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They have hushed, the watch-dogs, quieted or distracted, their attentive
      scent preoccupied by something else. The vast silence has returned, less
      reassuring, ready to break, perhaps, because beasts are watching. And, at
      a low command from Itchoua, the men begin again their march, slower and
      more hesitating, in the night of the plain, a little bent, a little
      lowered on their legs, like wild animals on the alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before them is the Nivelle; they do not see it, since they see nothing,
      but they hear it run, and now long, flexible things are in the way of
      their steps, are crushed by their bodies: the reeds on the shores. The
      Nivelle is the frontier; they will have to cross it on a series of
      slippery rocks, leaping from stone to stone, despite the loads that make
      the legs heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before doing this they halt on the shore to collect themselves and
      rest a little. And first, they call the roll in a low voice: all are
      there. The boxes have been placed in the grass; they seem clearer spots,
      almost perceptible to trained eyes, while, on the darkness in the
      background, the men, standing, make long, straight marks, blacker than the
      emptiness of the plain. Passing by Ramuntcho, Itchoua has whispered in his
      ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will you tell me about your plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a moment, at our return!&mdash;Oh, do not fear, Itchoua, I will tell
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment when his chest is heaving and his muscles are in action,
      all his faculties doubled and exasperated by his trade, he does not
      hesitate, Ramuntcho; in the present exaltation of his strength and of his
      combativeness he knows no moral obstacles nor scruples. The idea which
      came to his accomplice to associate himself with Itchoua frightens him no
      longer. So much the worse! He will surrender to the advice of that man of
      stratagem and of violence, even if he must go to the extreme of kidnapping
      and housebreaking. He is, to-night, the rebel from whom has been taken the
      companion of his life, the adored one, the one who may not be replaced; he
      wants her, at the risk of everything.&mdash;And while he thinks of her, in
      the progressive languor of that halt, he desires her suddenly with his
      senses, in a young, savage outbreak, in a manner unexpected and sovereign&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The immobility is prolonged, the respirations are calmer. And, while the
      men shake their dripping caps, pass their hands on their foreheads to wipe
      out drops of rain and perspiration that veil the eyes, the first sensation
      of cold comes to them, of a damp and profound cold; their wet clothes
      chill them, their thoughts weaken; little by little a sort of torpor
      benumbs them in the thick darkness, under the incessant winter rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are accustomed to this, trained to cold and to dampness, they are
      hardened prowlers who go to places where, and at hours when, other men
      never appear, they are inaccessible to vague frights of the darkness, they
      are capable of sleeping without shelter anywhere in the blackest of rainy
      nights, in dangerous marshes or hidden ravines&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the rest has lasted long enough. This is the decisive instant when the
      frontier is to be crossed. All muscles stiffen, ears stretch, eyes dilate.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, the skirmishers; then, one after another, the bundle carriers, the
      box carriers, each one loaded with a weight of forty kilos, on the
      shoulders or on the head. Slipping here and there among the round rocks,
      stumbling in the water, everybody crosses, lands on the other shore. Here
      they are on the soil of Spain! They have to cross, without gunshots or bad
      meetings, a distance of two hundred metres to reach an isolated farm which
      is the receiving shop of the chief of the Spanish smugglers, and once more
      the game will have been played!
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, it is without light, obscure and sinister, that farm.
      Noiselessly and groping they enter in a file; then, on the last who enter,
      enormous locks of the door are drawn. At last! Barricaded and rescued,
      all! And the treasury of the Queen Regent has been frustrated, again
      tonight, of a thousand francs&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, fagots are lighted in the chimney, a candle on the table; they see
      one another, they recognize one another, smiling at the success. The
      security, the truce of rain over their heads, the flame that dances and
      warms, the cider and the whiskey that fill the glasses, bring back to
      these men noisy joy after compelled silence. They talk gaily, and the
      tall, white-haired, old chief who receives them all at this undue hour,
      announces that he will give to his village a beautiful square for the
      pelota game, the plans of which have been drawn and the cost of which will
      be ten thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, tell me your affair,&rdquo; insists Itchoua, in Ramuntcho's ear. &ldquo;Oh, I
      suspect what it is! Gracieuse, eh?&mdash;That is it, is it not?&mdash;It
      is hard you know.&mdash;I do not like to do things against my religion,
      you know.&mdash;Then, I have my place as a chorister, which I might lose
      in such a game.&mdash;Let us see, how much money will you give me if I
      succeed?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had foreseen, Ramuntcho, that this sombre aid would cost him a great
      deal, Itchoua being, in truth, a churchman, whose conscience would have to
      be bought; and, much disturbed, with a flush on his cheeks, Ramuntcho
      grants, after a discussion, a thousand francs. Anyway, if he is piling up
      money, it is only to get Gracieuse, and if enough remains for him to go to
      America with her, what matters it?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that his secret is known to Itchoua, now that his cherished
      project is being elaborated in that obstinate and sharp brain, it seems to
      Ramuntcho that he has made a decisive step toward the execution of his
      plan, that all has suddenly become real and approaching. Then, in the
      midst of the lugubrious decay of the place, among these men who are less
      than ever similar to him, he isolates himself in an immense hope of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drink for a last time together, all around, clinking their glasses
      loudly; then they start again, in the thick night and under the incessant
      rain, but this time on the highway, in a band and singing. Nothing in the
      hands, nothing in the pockets: they are now ordinary people, returning
      from a natural promenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the rear guard, at a distance from the singers, Itchoua on his long
      legs walks with his hands resting on Ramuntcho's shoulder. Interested and
      ardent for success, since the sum has been agreed upon, Itchoua whispers
      in Ramuntcho's ear imperious advices. Like Arrochkoa, he wishes to act
      with stunning abruptness, in the surprise of a first interview which will
      occur in the evening, as late as the rule of a convent will permit, at an
      uncertain and twilight hour, when the village shall have begun to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Above all,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;do not show yourself beforehand. She must not have
      seen you, she must not even know that you have returned home! You must not
      lose the advantage of surprise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Ramuntcho listens and meditates in silence, the others, who lead the
      march, sing always the same old song that times their steps. And thus they
      re-enter Landachkoa, village of France, crossing the bridge of the
      Nivelle, under the beards of the Spanish carbineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have no sort of illusion, the watching carbineers, about what these
      men, so wet, have been doing at an hour so black.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The winter, the real winter, extended itself by degrees over the Basque
      land, after the few days of frost that had come to annihilate the annual
      plants, to change the deceptive aspect of the fields, to prepare the
      following spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ramuntcho acquired slowly his habits of one left alone; in his house,
      wherein he lived still, without anybody to serve him, he took care of
      himself, as in the colonies or in the barracks, knowing the thousand
      little details of housekeeping which careful soldiers practice. He
      preserved the pride of dress, dressed himself well, wore the ribbon of the
      brave at his buttonhole and a wide crape around his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he was not assiduous at the village cider mill, where the men
      assembled in the cold evenings. In his three years of travel, of reading,
      of talking with different people, too many new ideas had penetrated his
      already open mind; among his former companions he felt more outcast than
      before, more detached from the thousand little things which composed their
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, however, by dint of being alone, by dint of passing by
      the halls where the men drank,&mdash;on the window-panes of which a lamp
      always sketches the shadows of Basque caps,&mdash;he had made it a custom
      to go in and to sit at a table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the season when the Pyrenean villages, freed from the visitors
      which the summers bring, imprisoned by the clouds, the mist, or the snow,
      are more intensely as they were in ancient times. In these cider mills&mdash;sole,
      little, illuminated points, living, in the midst of the immense, empty
      darkness of the fields&mdash;something of the spirit of former times is
      reanimated in winter evenings. In front of the large casks of cider
      arranged in lines in the background where it is dark, the lamp, hanging
      from the beams, throws its light on the images of saints that decorate the
      walls, on the groups of mountaineers who talk and who smoke. At times
      someone sings a plaintive song which came from the night of centuries; the
      beating of a tambourine recalls to life old, forgotten rhythms; a guitar
      reawakens a sadness of the epoch of the Moors.&mdash;Or, in the face of
      each other, two men, with castanets in their hands, suddenly dance the
      fandango, swinging themselves with an antique grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, from these innocent, little inns, they retire early&mdash;especially
      in these bad, rainy nights&mdash;the darkness of which is so peculiarly
      propitious to smuggling, every one here having to do some clandestine
      thing on the Spanish side.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such places, in the company of Arrochkoa, Ramuntcho talked over and
      commented upon his cherished, sacrilegious project; or,&mdash;during the
      beautiful moon-light nights which do not permit of undertakings on the
      frontier&mdash;they talked on the roads for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Persistent religions scruples made him hesitate a great deal, although he
      hardly realized it. They were inexplicable scruples, since he had ceased
      to be a believer. But all his will, all his audacity, all his life, were
      concentrated and directed, more and more, toward this unique end.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the prohibition, ordered by Itchoua, from seeing Gracieuse before the
      great attempt, exasperated his impatient dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter, capricious as it is always in this country, pursued its
      unequal march, with, from time to time, surprises of sunlight and of heat.
      There were rains of a deluge, grand, healthy squalls which went up from
      the Bay of Biscay, plunged into the valleys, bending the trees furiously.
      And then, repetitions of the wind of the south, breaths as warm as in
      summer, breezes smelling of Africa, under a sky at once high and sombre,
      among mountains of an intense brown color. And also, glacial mornings,
      wherein one saw, at awakening, summits become snowy and white.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desire often seized him to finish everything.&mdash;But he had the
      frightful idea that he might not succeed and might fall again, alone
      forever, without a hope in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, reasonable pretexts to wait were not lacking. He had to settle
      with men of affairs, he had to sell the house and realize, for his flight,
      all the money that he could obtain. He had also to wait for the answer of
      Uncle Ignacio, to whom he had announced his emigration and at whose house
      he expected to find an asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the days went by, and soon the hasty spring was to ferment. Already
      the yellow primrose and the blue gentian, in advance here by several
      weeks, were in bloom in the woods and along the paths, in the last suns of
      January&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      They are this time in the cider mill of the hamlet of Gastelugain, near
      the frontier, waiting for the moment to go out with boxes of jewelry and
      weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is Itchoua who is talking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she hesitates&mdash;and she will not hesitate, be sure of it&mdash;but
      if she hesitates, well! we will kidnap her.&mdash;Let me arrange this, my
      plan is all made. It will be in the evening, you understand?&mdash;We will
      bring her anywhere and imprison her in a room with you.&mdash;If it turns
      out badly&mdash;if I am forced to quit the country after having done this
      thing to please you; then, you will have to give me more money than the
      amount agreed upon, you understand?&mdash;Enough, at least, to let me seek
      for my bread in Spain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Spain!&mdash;What? What are you going to do, Itchoua? I hope you have
      not in your head the idea to do things that are too grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do not be afraid, my friend. I have no desire to assassinate
      anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! You talk of running away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said this as I would have said anything else, you know. For some time,
      business has been bad. And then, suppose the thing turns out badly and the
      police make an inquiry. Well, I would prefer to go, that is sure.&mdash;For
      whenever these men of justice put their noses into anything, they seek for
      things that happened long ago, and the inquiry never ends&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his eyes, suddenly expressive, appeared crime and fear. And Ramuntcho
      looked with an increase of anxiety at this man, who was believed to be
      solidly established in the country with lands in the sunlight, and who
      accepted so easily the idea of running away. What sort of a bandit is he
      then, to be so much afraid of justice?&mdash;And what could be these
      things that happened long ago?&mdash;After a silence between them,
      Ramuntcho said in a lower voice, with extreme distrust:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imprison her&mdash;you say this seriously, Itchoua?&mdash;And where
      imprison her, if you please? I have no castle to hide her in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Itchoua, with the smile of a faun which no one had seen before,
      tapped his shoulder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, imprison her&mdash;for one night only, my son!&mdash;It will be
      enough, you may believe me.&mdash;They are all alike, you see: the first
      step costs; but the second one, they make it all alone, and quicker than
      you may think. Do you imagine that she would wish to return to the good
      sisters, afterward?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The desire to slap that dull face passed like an electric shock through
      the arm and the hand of Ramuntcho. He constrained himself, however,
      through a long habit of respectfulness for the old singer of the
      liturgies, and remained silent, with a flush on his cheeks, and his look
      turned aside. It revolted him to hear one talk thus of her&mdash;and
      surprised him that the one who spoke thus was that Itchoua whom he had
      always known as the quiet husband of an ugly and old woman. But the blow
      struck by the impertinent phrase followed nevertheless, in his
      imagination, a dangerous and unforeseen path.&mdash;Gracieuse, &ldquo;imprisoned
      a room with him!&rdquo; The immediate possibility of such a thing, so clearly
      presented with a rough and coarse word, made his head swim like a very
      violent liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved her with too elevated a tenderness, his betrothed, to find
      pleasure in brutal hopes. Ordinarily, he expelled from his mind those
      images; but now that man had just placed them under his eye, with a
      diabolical crudity, and he felt shivers in his flesh, he trembled as if
      the weather were cold&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, whether the adventure fell or not under the blow of justice, well, so
      much the worse, after all! He had nothing to lose, all was indifferent to
      him! And from that evening, in the fever of a new desire, he felt more
      boldly decided to brave the rules, the laws, the obstacles of this world.
      Saps ascended everywhere around him, on the sides of the brown Pyrenees;
      there were longer and more tepid nights; the paths were bordered with
      violets and periwinkles.&mdash;But religious scruples held him still. They
      remained, inexplicably in the depth of his disordered mind: instinctive
      horror of profanation; belief, in spite of everything, in something
      supernatural enveloping, to defend them, churches and cloisters&mdash;

      The winter had just come to an end.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho,&mdash;who had slept for a few hours, in a bad, tired sleep, in
      a small room of the new house of his friend Florentino, at Ururbil,&mdash;awakened
      as the day dawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night,&mdash;a night of tempest everywhere, a black and troubled
      night,&mdash;had been disastrous for the smugglers. Near Cape Figuier, in
      the rocks where they had just landed from the sea with silk bundles, they
      had been pursued with gunshots, compelled to throw away their loads,
      losing everything, some fleeing to the mountain, others escaping by
      swimming among the breakers, in order to reach the French shore, in terror
      of the prisons of San Sebastian.
    </p>
    <p>
      At two o'clock in the morning, exhausted, drenched and half drowned, he
      had knocked at the door of that isolated house, to ask from the good
      Florentino his aid and an asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on awakening, after all the nocturnal noise of the equinoctial storm,
      of the rain, of the groaning branches, twisted and broken, he perceived
      that a grand silence had come. Straining his ear, he could hear no longer
      the immense breath of the western wind, no longer the motion of all those
      things tormented in the darkness. No, nothing except a far-off noise,
      regular, powerful, continued and formidable; the roll of the waters in the
      depth of that Bay of Biscay&mdash;which, since the beginning, is without
      truce and troubled; a rhythmic groan, as might be the monstrous
      respiration of the sea in its sleep; a series of profound blows which
      seemed the blows of a battering ram on a wall, continued every time by a
      music of surf on the beaches.&mdash;But the air, the trees and the
      surrounding things were immovable; the tempest had finished, without
      reasonable cause, as it had begun, and the sea alone prolonged the
      complaint of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To look at that land, that Spanish coast which he would perhaps never see
      again, since his departure was so near, he opened his window on the
      emptiness, still pale, on the virginity of the desolate dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gray light emanating from a gray sky; everywhere the same immobility,
      tired and frozen, with uncertainties of aspect derived from the night and
      from dreams. An opaque sky, which had a solid air and was made of
      accumulated, small, horizontal layers, as if one had painted it by
      superposing pastes of dead colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      And underneath, mountains black brown; then Fontarabia in a morose
      silhouette, its old belfry appearing blacker and more worn by the years.
      At that hour, so early and so freshly mysterious, when the ears of most
      men are not yet open, it seemed as if one surprised things in their
      heartbreaking colloquy of lassitude and of death, relating to one another,
      at the first flush of dawn, all that they do not say when the day has
      risen.&mdash;What was the use of resisting the storm of last night? said
      the old belfry, sad and weary, standing in the background in the distance;
      what was the use, since other storms will come, eternally others, other
      storms and other tempests, and since I will pass away, I whom men have
      elevated as a signal of prayer to remain here for incalculable years?&mdash;I
      am already only a spectre, come from some other time; I continue to ring
      ceremonies and illusory festivals; but men will soon cease to be lured by
      them; I ring also knells, I have rung so many knells for thousands of dead
      persons whom nobody remembers! And I remain here, useless, under the
      effort, almost eternal, of all those western winds which blow from the sea&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the belfry, the church, drawn in gray tints, with an air of
      age and abandonment, confessed also that it was empty, that it was vain,
      peopled only by poor images made of wood or of stone, by myths without
      comprehension, without power and without pity. And all the houses, piously
      grouped for centuries around it, avowed that its protection was not
      efficacious against death, that it was deceptive and untruthful&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And especially the clouds, the clouds and the mountains, covered with
      their immense, mute attestation what the old city murmured beneath them;
      they confirmed in silence the sombre truths: heaven empty as the churches
      are, serving for accidental phantasmagoria, and uninterrupted times
      rolling their flood, wherein thousands of lives, like insignificant
      nothings, are, one after another, dragged and drowned.&mdash;A knell began
      to ring in that distance which Ramuntcho saw whitening; very slowly, the
      old belfry gave its voice, once more, for the end of a life; someone was
      in the throes of death on the other side of the frontier, some Spanish
      soul over there was going out, in the pale morning, under the thickness of
      those imprisoning clouds&mdash;and he had almost the precise notion that
      this soul would very simply follow its body in the earth which decomposes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ramuntcho contemplated and listened. At the little window of that
      Basque house, which before him had sheltered only generations of
      simple-minded and confident people, leaning on the wide sill which the
      rubbing of elbows had worn, pushing the old shutter painted green, he
      rested his eyes on the dull display of that corner of the world which had
      been his and which he was to quit forever. Those revelations which things
      made, his uncultured mind heard them for the first time and he lent to
      them a frightened attention. An entire new labor of unbelief was going on
      suddenly in his mind, prepared by heredity to doubts and to worry. An
      entire vision came to him, sudden and seemingly definitive, of the
      nothingness of religions, of the nonexistence of the divinities whom men
      supplicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;since there was nothing, how simple it was to tremble still
      before the white Virgin, chimerical protector of those convents where
      girls are imprisoned&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor agony bell, which exhausted itself in ringing over there so
      puerilely to call for useless prayers, stopped at last, and, under the
      closed sky, the respiration of the grand waters alone was heard in the
      distance, in the universal silence. But the things continued, in the
      uncertain dawn, their dialogue without words: nothing anywhere; nothing in
      the old churches venerated for so long a time; nothing in the sky where
      clouds and mists amass; but always, in the flight of times, the eternal
      and exhausting renewal of beings; and always and at once, old age, death,
      ashes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      That is what they were saying, in the pale half light, the things so dull
      and so tired. And Ramuntcho, who had heard, pitied himself for having
      hesitated so long for imaginary reasons. To himself he swore, with a
      harsher despair, that this morning he was decided; that he would do it, at
      the risk of everything; that nothing would make him hesitate longer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Weeks have elapsed, in preparations, in anxious uncertainties on the
      manner of acting, in abrupt changes of plans and ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between times, the reply of Uncle Ignacio has reached Etchezar. If his
      nephew had spoken sooner, Ignacio has written, he would have been glad to
      receive him at his house; but, seeing how he hesitated, Ignacio had
      decided to take a wife, although he is already an old man, and now he has
      a child two months old. Therefore, there is no protection to be expected
      from that side; the exile, when he arrives there, may not find even a home&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The family house has been sold, at the notary's money questions have been
      settled; all the goods of Ramuntcho have been transformed into gold pieces
      which are in his hand&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now is the day of the supreme attempt, the great day,&mdash;and
      already the thick foliage has returned to the trees, the clothing of the
      tall grass covers anew the prairies; it is May.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the little wagon, which the famous fast horse drags, they roll on the
      shady mountain paths, Arrochkoa and Ramuntcho, toward that village of
      Amezqueta. They roll quickly; they plunge into the heart of an infinite
      region of trees. And, as the hour goes by, all becomes more peaceful
      around them, and more savage; more primitive, the hamlets; more solitary,
      the Basque land.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the shade of the branches, on the borders of the paths, there are pink
      foxgloves, silences, ferns, almost the same flora as in Brittany; these
      two countries, the Basque and the Breton, resemble each other by the
      granite which is everywhere and by the habitual rain; by the immobility
      also, and by the continuity of the same religious dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the two young men who have started for the adventure, thicken the
      big, customary clouds, the sombre and low sky. The route which they
      follow, in these mountains ever and ever higher, is deliciously green, dug
      in the shade, between walls of ferns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immobility of several centuries, immobility in beings and in things,&mdash;one
      has more and more the consciousness of it as one penetrates farther into
      this country of forests and of silence. Under this obscure veil of the
      sky, where are lost the summits of the grand Pyrenees, appear and run by,
      isolated houses, centenary farms, hamlets more and more rare,&mdash;and
      they go always under the same vault of oaks, of ageless chestnut trees,
      which twist even at the side of the path their roots like mossy serpents.
      They resemble one another, those hamlets separated from one another by so
      much forest, by so many branches, and inhabited by an antique race,
      disdainful of all that disturbs, of all that changes: the humble church,
      most often without a belfry, with a simple campanila on its gray facade,
      and the square, with its wall painted for that traditional ball-game
      wherein, from father to son, the men exercise their hard muscles.
      Everywhere reigned the healthy peace of rustic life, the traditions of
      which in the Basque land are more immutable than elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The few woolen caps which the two bold young men meet on their rapid
      passage, incline all in a bow, from general politeness first, and from
      acquaintance above all, for they are, Arrochkoa and Ramuntcho, the two
      celebrated pelota players of the country;&mdash;Ramuntcho, it is true, had
      been forgotten by many people, but Arrochkoa, everybody, from Bayonne to
      San Sebastian, knows his face with healthy colors and the turned up ends
      of his catlike mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dividing the journey into two stages, they have slept last night at
      Mendichoco. And at present they are rolling quickly, the two young men, so
      preoccupied doubtless that they hardly care to regulate the pace of their
      vigorous beast.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Itchoua, however, is not with them. At the last moment, a fear has
come to Ramuntcho of this accomplice, whom he felt to be capable of
everything, even of murder; in a sudden terror, he has refused the aid
of that man, who clutched the bridle of the horse to prevent it from
starting; and feverishly, Ramuntcho has thrown gold into his hands, to
pay for his advice, to buy the liberty to act alone, the assurance,
at least, of not committing a crime: piece by piece, to break his
engagement, he has given to Itchoua a half of the agreed price. Then,
when the horse is driven at a gallop, when the implacable figure has
vanished behind a group of trees, Ramuntcho has felt his conscience
lighter&mdash;

 &ldquo;You will leave my carriage at Aranotz, at Burugoity, the inn-keeper's,
who understands,&rdquo; said Arrochkoa, &ldquo;for, you understand, as soon as you
have accomplished your end I will leave you.&mdash;We have business with the
people of Buruzabal, horses to lead into Spain to-night, not far from
Amezqueta, and I promised to be there before ten o'clock&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      What will they do? They do not know, the two allied friends; this will
      depend on the turn that things take; they have different projects, all
      bold and skilful, according to the cases which might present themselves.
      Two places have been reserved, one for Ramuntcho and the other for her, on
      board a big emigrant vessel on which the baggage is embarked and which
      will start tomorrow night from Bordeaux carrying hundreds of Basques to
      America. At this small station of Aranotz, where the carriage will leave
      both of them, Ramuntcho and Gracieuse, they will take the train for
      Bayonne, at three o'clock in the morning, and, at Bayonne afterward, the
      Irun express to Bordeaux. It will be a hasty flight, which will not give
      to the little fugitive the time to think, to regain her senses in her
      terror,&mdash;doubtless also in her intoxication deliciously mortal&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A gown, a mantilla of Gracieuse are all ready, at the bottom of the
      carriage, to replace the veil and the black uniform: things which she wore
      formerly, before her vows, and which Arrochkoa found in his mother's
      closets. And Ramuntcho thinks that it will be perhaps real, in a moment,
      that she will be perhaps there, at his side, very near, on that narrow
      seat, enveloped with him in the same travelling blanket, flying in the
      midst of night, to belong to him, at once and forever;&mdash;and in
      thinking of this too much, he feels again a shudder and a dizziness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that she will follow you,&rdquo; repeats his friend, striking him
      rudely on the leg in protective encouragement, as soon as he sees
      Ramuntcho sombre and lost in a dream. &ldquo;I tell you that she will follow
      you, I am sure! If she hesitates, well, leave the rest to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If she hesitates, then they will be violent, they are resolved, oh, not
      very violent, only enough to unlace the hands of the old nuns retaining
      her.&mdash;And then, they will carry her into the small wagon, where
      infallibly the enlacing contact and the tenderness of her former friend
      will soon turn her young head.
    </p>
    <p>
      How will it all happen? They do not yet know, relying a great deal on
      their spirit of decision which has already dragged them out of dangerous
      passes. But what they know is that they will not weaken. And they go
      ahead, exciting each other; one would say that they are united now unto
      death, firm and decided like two bandits at the hour when the capital game
      is to be played.
    </p>
    <p>
      The land of thick branches which they traverse, under the oppression of
      very high mountains which they do not see, is all in ravines, profound and
      torn up, in precipices, where torrents roar under the green night of the
      foliage. The oaks, the beeches, the chestnut trees become more and more
      enormous, living through centuries off a sap ever fresh and magnificent. A
      powerful verdure is strewn over that disturbed geology; for ages it covers
      and classifies it under the freshness of its immovable mantle. And this
      nebulous sky, almost obscure, which is familiar to the Basque country,
      adds to the impression which they have of a sort of universal meditation
      wherein the things are plunged; a strange penumbra descends from
      everywhere, descends from the trees at first, descends from the thick,
      gray veils above the branches, descends from the great Pyrenees hidden
      behind the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in the midst of this immense peace and of this green night, they
      pass, Ramuntcho and Arrochkoa, like two young disturbers going to break
      charms in the depths of forests. At all cross roads old, granite crosses
      rise, like alarm signals to warn them; old crosses with this inscription,
      sublimely simple, which is here something like the device of an entire
      race: &ldquo;O crux, ave, spes unica!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon the night will come. Now they are silent, because the hour is going,
      because the moment approaches, because all these crosses on the road are
      beginning to intimidate them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the day falls, under that sad veil which covers the sky. The valleys
      become more savage, the country more deserted. And, at the corners of
      roads, the old crosses appear, ever with their similar inscriptions: &ldquo;O
      crux, ave, spes unica!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amezqueta, at the last twilight. They stop their carriage at an outskirt
      of the village, before the cider mill. Arrochkoa is impatient to go into
      the house of the sisters, vexed at arriving so late; he fears that the
      door may not be opened to them. Ramuntcho, silent, lets him act.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is above, on the hill; it is that isolated house which a cross
      surmounts and which one sees in relief in white on the darker mass of the
      mountain. They recommend that as soon as the horse is rested the wagon be
      brought to them, at a turn, to wait for them. Then, both go into the
      avenue of trees which leads to that convent and where the thickness of the
      May foliage makes the obscurity almost nocturnal. Without saying anything
      to each other, without making a noise with their sandals, they ascend in a
      supple and easy manner; around them the profound fields are impregnated by
      the immense melancholy of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrochkoa knocks with his finger on the door of the peaceful house:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to see my sister, if you please,&rdquo; he says to an old nun who
      opens the door, astonished&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he has finished talking, a cry of joy comes from the dark corridor,
      and a nun, whom one divines is young in spite of the envelopment of her
      dissembling costume, comes and takes his hand. She has recognized him by
      his voice,&mdash;but has she divined the other who stays behind and does
      not talk?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mother Superior has come also, and, in the darkness of the stairway,
      she makes them go up to the parlor of the little country convent; then she
      brings the cane-seat chairs and everyone sits down, Arrochkoa near his
      sister, Ramuntcho opposite,&mdash;and they face each other at last, the
      two lovers, and a silence, full of the beating of arteries, full of leaps
      of hearts, full of fever, descends upon them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly, in this place, one knows not what peace almost sweet, and a little
      sepulchral also, envelopes the terrible interview; in the depth of the
      chests, the hearts beat with great blows, but the words of love or of
      violence, the words die before passing the lips.&mdash;And this peace,
      more and more establishes itself; it seems as if a white shroud little by
      little is covering everything, in order to calm and to extinguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing very peculiar, however, in this humble parlor: four walls
      absolutely bare under a coat of whitewash; a wooden ceiling; a floor where
      one slips, so carefully waxed it is; on a table, a plaster Virgin, already
      indistinct, among all the similar white things of the background where the
      twilight of May is dying. And a window without curtains, open on the grand
      Pyrenean horizons invaded by night.&mdash;But, from this voluntary
      poverty, from this white simplicity, is exhaled a notion of definitive
      impersonality, of renunciation forever; and the irremediability of
      accomplished things begins to manifest itself to the mind of Ramuntcho,
      while bringing to him a sort of peace, of sudden and involuntary
      resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two smugglers, immovable on their chairs, appear as silhouettes, of
      wide shoulders on all this white of the walls, and of their lost features
      one hardly sees the black more intense of the mustache and the eyes. The
      two nuns, whose outlines are unified by the veil, seem already to be two
      spectres all black&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Sister Mary Angelique,&rdquo; says the Mother Superior to the transformed
      young girl who was formerly named Gracieuse, &ldquo;wait sister till I light the
      lamp in order that you may at least see your brother's face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She goes out, leaving them together, and, again, silence falls on this
      rare instant, perhaps unique, impossible to regain, when they are alone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She comes back with a little lamp which makes the eyes of the smugglers
      shine,&mdash;and with a gay voice, a kind air, asks, looking at Ramuntcho:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this one? A second brother, I suppose?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; says Arrochkoa in a singular tone. &ldquo;He is only my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth, he is not their brother, that Ramuntcho who stays there,
      ferocious and mute.&mdash;And how he would frighten the quiet nuns if they
      knew what storm brings him here&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      The same silence returns, heavy and disquieting, on these beings who, it
      seems, should talk simply of simple things; and the old Mother Superior
      remarks it, is astonished by it.&mdash;But the quick eyes of Ramuntcho
      become immovable, veil themselves as if they are fascinated by some
      invisible tamer. Under the harsh envelope, still beating, of his chest,
      the calmness, the imposed calmness continues to penetrate and to extend.
      On him, doubtless, are acting the mysterious, white powers which are here
      in the air; religious heredities which were asleep in the depths of his
      being fill him now with unexpected respect and submissiveness; the antique
      symbols dominate him: the crosses met in the evening along the road and
      that plaster Virgin of the color of snow, immaculate on the spotless white
      of the wall&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my children, talk of the things of Etchezar,&rdquo; says the Mother
      Superior to Gracieuse and to her brother. &ldquo;We shall leave you alone, if
      you wish,&rdquo; she adds with a sign to Ramuntcho to follow her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; protests Arrochkoa, &ldquo;Let him stay.&mdash;No, he is not the one&mdash;who
      prevents us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the little nun, veiled in the fashion of the Middle Age, lowers her
      head, to maintain her eyes hidden in the shade of her austere headdress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door remains open, the window remains open; the house, the things
      retain their air of absolute confidence, of absolute security, against
      violations and sacrilege. Now two other sisters, who are very old, set a
      small table, put two covers, bring to Arrochkoa and to his friend a little
      supper, a loaf of bread, cheese, cake, grapes from the arbor. In arranging
      these things they have a youthful gaiety, a babble almost childish&mdash;and
      all this is strangely opposed to the ardent violence which is here,
      hushed, thrown back into the depth of minds, as under the blows of some
      mace covered with white&mdash;

    <p>
      And, in spite of themselves, they are seated at the table, the two
      smugglers, opposite each other, yielding to insistence and eating
      absent-mindedly the frugal things, on a cloth as white as the walls. Their
      broad shoulders, accustomed to loads, lean on the backs of the little
      chairs and make their frail wood crack. Around them come and go the
      Sisters, ever with their discreet talk and their puerile laugh, which
      escape, somewhat softened, from under their veils. Alone, she remains mute
      and motionless, Sister Mary Angelique: standing near her brother who is
      seated, she places her hand on his powerful shoulder; so lithe beside him
      that she looks like a saint of a primitive church picture. Ramuntcho,
      sombre, observes them both; he had not been able to see yet the face of
      Gracieuse, so severely her headdress framed it. They resemble each other
      still, the brother and the sister; in their very long eyes, which have
      acquired expressions more than ever different remains something
      inexplicably similar, persists the same flame, that flame which impelled
      one toward adventures and the life of the muscles, the other toward mystic
      dreams, toward mortification and annihilation of flesh. But she has become
      as frail as he is robust; her breast doubtless is no more, nor her hips;
      the black vestment wherein her body remains hidden falls straight like a
      furrow enclosing nothing carnal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, for the first time, they are face to face, Gracieuse and
      Ramuntcho; their eyes have met and gazed on one another. She does not
      lower her head before him; but it is as from an infinite distance that she
      looks at him, it is as from behind white mists that none may scale, as
      from the other side of an abyss, as from the other side of death; very
      soft, nevertheless, her glance indicates that she is as if she were
      absent, gone to tranquil and inaccessible other places.&mdash;And it is
      Ramuntcho at last who, still more tamed, lowers his ardent eyes before her
      virgin eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They continue to babble, the Sisters; they would like to retain them both
      at Amezqueta for the night: the weather, they say, is so black, and a
      storm threatens.&mdash;M. the Cure, who went out to take communion to a
      patient in the mountain, will come back; he has known Arrochkoa at
      Etchezar when a vicar there; he would be glad to give him a room in the
      parish house&mdash;and one to his friend also, of course&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But no, Arrochkoa refuses, after a questioning glance at Ramuntcho. It is
      impossible to stay in the village; they will even go at once, or after a
      few moments of conversation, for they are expected on the Spanish
      frontier.&mdash;Gracieuse who, at first, in her mortal disturbance of
      mind, had not dared to talk, begins to question her brother. Now in
      Basque, then in French, she asks for news of those whom she has forever
      abandoned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mother? All alone now in the house, even at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; says Arrochkoa, &ldquo;Catherine watches over her and sleeps at the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is your child, Arrochkoa, has he been christened? What is his
      name? Lawrence, doubtless, like his grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Etchezar, their village, is separated from Amezqueta by some sixty
      kilometres, in a land without more means of communication than in the past
      centuries:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in spite of the distance,&rdquo; says the little nun, &ldquo;I get news of you
      sometimes. Last month, people here had met on the market place of
      Hasparren, women of our village; that is how I learned&mdash;many things.&mdash;At
      Easter I had hoped to see you; I was told that there would be a ball-game
      at Erricalde and that you would come to play there; then I said to myself
      that perhaps you would come here&mdash;and, while the festival lasted, I
      looked often at the road through this window, to see if you were coming&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she shows the window, open on the blackness of the savage country&mdash;from
      which ascends an immense silence, with, from time to time, the noise of
      spring, intermittent musical notes of crickets and tree-toads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing her talk so quietly, Ramuntcho feels confounded by this
      renunciation of all things; she appears to him still more irrevocably
      changed, far-off&mdash;poor little nun!&mdash;Her name was Gracieuse; now
      her name is Sister Mary Angelique, and she has no relatives; impersonal
      here, in this little house with white walls, without terrestrial hope and
      without desire, perhaps&mdash;one might as well say that she has departed
      for the regions of the grand oblivion of death. And yet, she smiles, quite
      serene now and apparently not even suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrochkoa looks at Ramuntcho, questions him with a piercing eye accustomed
      to fathom the black depths&mdash;and, tamed himself by all this unexpected
      peace, he understands very well that his bold comrade dares no longer,
      that all the projects have fallen, that all is useless and inert in
      presence of the invisible wall with which his sister is surrounded. At
      moments, pressed to end all in one way or in another, in a haste to break
      this charm or to submit to it and to fly before it, he pulls his watch,
      says that it is time to go, because of the friends who are waiting for
      them.&mdash;The Sisters know well who these friends are and why they are
      waiting but they are not affected by this: Basques themselves, daughters
      and granddaughters of Basques, they have the blood of smugglers in their
      veins and consider such things indulgently&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, for the first time, Gracieuse titters the name of Ramuntcho; not
      daring, however, to address him directly, she asks her brother, with a
      calm smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is with you, Ramuntcho, now? You work together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence follows, and Arrochkoa looks at Ramuntcho.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; says the latter, in a slow and sombre voice, &ldquo;no&mdash;I, I go
      to-morrow to America&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every word of this reply, harshly scanned, is like a sound of trouble and
      of defiance in the midst of that strange serenity. She leans more heavily
      on her brother's shoulder, the little nun, and Ramuntcho, conscious of the
      profound blow which he has struck, looks at her and envelopes her with his
      tempting eyes, having regained his audacity, attractive and dangerous in
      the last effort of his heart full of love, of his entire being of youth
      and of flame made for tenderness.&mdash;Then, for an uncertain minute, it
      seems as if the little convent had trembled; it seems as if the white
      powers of the air recoiled, went out like sad, unreal mists before this
      young dominator, come here to hurl the triumphant appeal of life. And the
      silence which follows is the heaviest of all the silent moments which have
      interrupted already that species of drama played almost without words&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Sister Mary Angelique talks, and talks to Ramuntcho himself.
      Really it does not seem as if her heart had just been torn supremely by
      the announcement of that departure, nor as if she had just shuddered under
      that lover's look.&mdash;With a voice which little by little becomes
      firmer in softness, she says very simple things, as to any friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;Uncle Ignacio?&mdash;I had always thought that you would go
      to rejoin him there.&mdash;We shall all pray the Holy Virgin to accompany
      you in your voyage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it is the smuggler who lowers the head, realizing that all is ended,
      that she is lost forever, the little companion of his childhood; that she
      has been buried in an inviolable shroud.&mdash;The words of love and of
      temptation which he had thought of saying, the projects which he had
      revolved in his mind for months, all these seemed insensate, sacrilegious,
      impossible things, childish bravadoes.&mdash;Arrochkoa, who looks at him
      attentively, is under the same irresistible and light charm; they
      understand each other and, to one another, without words, they confess
      that there is nothing to do, that they will never dare&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless an anguish still human appears in the eyes of Sister Mary
      Angelique when Arrochkoa rises for the definite departure: she prays, in a
      changed voice, for them to stay a moment longer. And Ramuntcho suddenly
      feels like throwing himself on his knees in front of her; his head on the
      hem of her veil, sobbing all the tears that stifle him; like begging for
      mercy, like begging for mercy also of that Mother Superior who has so soft
      an air; like telling both of them that this sweetheart of his childhood
      was his hope, his courage, his life, and that people must have a little
      pity, people must give her back to him, because, without her, there is no
      longer anything.&mdash;All that his heart contains that is infinitely good
      is exalted at present into an immense necessity to implore, into an
      outbreak of supplicating prayer and also into a confidence in the
      kindness, in the pity of others&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And who knows, if he had dared formulate that great prayer of pure
      tenderness, who knows what he might have awakened of kindness also, and of
      tenderness and of humanity in the poor, black-veiled girl?&mdash;Perhaps
      this old Mother Superior herself, this old, dried-up girl with childish
      smile and grave, pure eyes, would have opened her arms to him, as to a
      son, understanding everything, forgiving everything, despite the rules and
      despite the vows? And perhaps Gracieuse might have been returned to him,
      without kidnapping, without deception, almost excused by her companions of
      the cloister. Or at last, if that was impossible, she would have bade him
      a long farewell, consoling, softened by a kiss of immaterial love&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But no, he stays there mute on his chair. Even that prayer he cannot make.
      And it is the hour to go, decidedly. Arrochkoa is up, agitated, calling
      him with an imperious sign of the head. Then he straightens up also his
      proud bust and takes his cap to follow Arrochkoa. They express their
      thanks for the little supper which was given to them and they say
      good-night, timidly. During their entire visit they were very respectful,
      almost timid, the two superb smugglers. And, as if hope had not just been
      undone, as if one of them was not leaving behind him his life, they
      descend quietly the neat stairway, between the white walls, while the good
      Sisters light the way with their little lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Sister Mary Angelique,&rdquo; gaily proposes the Mother Superior, in her
      frail, infantile voice, &ldquo;we shall escort them to the end of our avenue,
      you know, near the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Is she an old fairy, sure of her power, or a simple and unconscious woman,
      playing without knowing it, with a great, devouring fire?&mdash;It was all
      finished; the parting had been accomplished; the farewell accepted; the
      struggle stifled under white wadding,&mdash;and now the two who adored
      each other are walking side by side, outside, in the tepid night of
      spring!&mdash;in the amorous, enveloping night, under the cover of the new
      leaves and on the tall grass, among all the saps that ascend in the midst
      of the sovereign growth of universal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walk with short steps, through this exquisite obscurity, as in silent
      accord, to make the shaded path last longer, both mute, in the ardent
      desire and the intense fear of contact of their clothes, of a touch of
      their hands. Arrochkoa and the Mother Superior follow them closely, on
      their heels; without talking, nuns with their sandals, smugglers with
      their rope soles, they go through these soft, dark spots without making
      more noise than phantoms, and their little cortege, slow and strange,
      descends toward the wagon in a funereal silence. Silence also around them,
      everywhere in the grand, ambient black, in the depth of the mountains and
      the woods. And, in the sky without stars, sleep the big clouds, heavy with
      all the water that the soil awaits and which will fall to-morrow to make
      the woods still more leafy, the grass still higher; the big clouds above
      their heads cover all the splendor of the southern summer which so often,
      in their childhood, charmed them together, disturbed them together, but
      which Ramuntcho will doubtless never see again and which in the future
      Gracieuse will have to look at with eyes of one dead, without
      understanding nor recognizing it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no one around them, in the little obscure alley, and the village
      seems asleep already. The night has fallen quite; its grand mystery is
      scattered everywhere, on the mountains and the savage valleys.&mdash;And,
      how easy it would be to execute what these two young men have resolved, in
      that solitude, with that wagon which is ready and that fast horse&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, without having talked, without having touched each other, they
      come, the lovers, to that turn of the path where they must bid each other
      an eternal farewell. The wagon is there, held by a boy; the lantern is
      lighted and the horse impatient. The Mother Superior stops: it is,
      apparently, the last point of the last walk which they will take together
      in this world,&mdash;and she feels the power, that old nun, to decide that
      it will be thus, without appeal. With the same little, thin voice, almost
      gay, she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Sister, say good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she says that with the assurance of a Fate whose decrees of death are
      not disputable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, nobody attempts to resist her order, impassibly given. He is
      vanquished, the rebellious Ramuntcho, oh, quite vanquished by the
      tranquil, white powers; trembling still from the battle which has just
      come to an end in him, he lowers his head, without will now, and almost
      without thought, as under the influence of some sleeping potion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Sister, say good-bye,&rdquo; the old, tranquil Fate has said. Then,
      seeing that Gracieuse has only taken Arrochkoa's hand, she adds:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you do not kiss your brother?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless, the little Sister Mary Angelique asks for nothing better, to
      kiss him with all her heart, with all her soul; to clasp him, her brother,
      to lean on his shoulder and to seek his protection, at that hour of
      superhuman sacrifice when she must let the cherished one leave her without
      even a word of love.&mdash;And still, her kiss has in it something
      frightened, at once drawn back; the kiss of a nun, somewhat similar to the
      kiss of one dead.&mdash;When will she ever see him again, that brother,
      who is not to leave the Basque country, however? When will she have news
      of her mother, of the house, of the village, from some passer-by who will
      stop here, coming from Etchezar?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will pray,&rdquo; she says again, &ldquo;to the Holy Virgin to protect you in your
      long voyage&mdash;&rdquo; And how they go; slowly they turn back, like silent
      shades, toward the humble convent which the cross protects, and the two
      tamed smugglers, immovable on the road, look at their veils, darker than
      the night of the trees, disappearing in the obscure avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! she is wrecked also, the one who will disappear in the darkness of the
      little, shady hill.&mdash;But she is nevertheless soothed by white,
      peaceful vapors, and all that she suffers will soon be quieted under a
      sort of sleep. To-morrow she will take again, until death, the course of
      her strangely simple existence; impersonal, devoted to a series of daily
      duties which never change, absorbed in a reunion of creatures almost
      neutral, who have abdicated everything, she will be able to walk with eyes
      lifted ever toward the soft, celestial mirage&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      O crux, ave, spes unica&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      To live, without variety or truce to the end, between the white walls of a
      cell always the same, now here, then elsewhere, at the pleasure of a
      strange will, in one of those humble village convents to which one has not
      even the leisure to become attached. On this earth, to possess nothing and
      to desire nothing, to wait for nothing, to hope for nothing. To accept as
      empty and transitory the fugitive hours of this world, and to feel freed
      from everything, even from love, as much as by death.&mdash;The mystery of
      such lives remains forever unintelligible to those young men who are
      there, made for the daily battle, beautiful beings of instinct and of
      strength, a prey to all the desires; created to enjoy life and to suffer
      from it, to love it and to continue it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      O crux, ave, spes unica!&mdash;One sees them no longer, they have
      re-entered their little, solitary convent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men have not exchanged even a word on their abandoned undertaking,
      on the ill-defined cause which for the first time has undone their
      courage; they feel, toward one another, almost a sense of shame of their
      sudden and insurmountable timidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant their proud heads were turned toward the nuns slowly
      fleeing; now they look at each other through the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are going to part, and probably forever: Arrochkoa puts into his
      friends hands the reins of the little wagon which, according to his
      promise, he lends to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my poor Ramuntcho!&rdquo; he says, in a tone of commiseration hardly
      affectionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the unexpressed end of the phrase signifies clearly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, since you have failed; and I have to go and meet my friends&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramuntcho would have kissed him with all his heart for the last farewell,&mdash;and
      in this embrace of the brother of the beloved one, he would have shed
      doubtless good, hot tears which, for a moment at least, would have cured
      him a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no, Arrochkoa has become again the Arrochkoa of the bad days, the
      gambler without soul, that only bold things interest. Absentmindedly, he
      touches Ramuntcho's hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye!&mdash;Good luck&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, with silent steps, he goes toward the smugglers, toward the frontier,
      toward the propitious darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ramuntcho, alone in the world now, whips the little, mountain horse
      who gallops with his light tinkling of bells.&mdash;That train which will
      pass by Aranotz, that vessel which will start from Bordeaux&mdash;an
      instinct impels Ramuntcho not to miss them. Mechanically he hastens, no
      longer knowing why, like a body without a mind which continues to obey an
      ancient impulsion, and, very quickly, he who has no aim and no hope in the
      world, plunges into the savage country, into the thickness of the woods,
      in all that profound blackness of the night of May, which the nuns, from
      their elevated window, see around them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      For him the native land is closed, closed forever; finished are the
      delicious dreams of his first years. He is a plant uprooted from the dear,
      Basque soil and which a breath of adventure blows elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the horse's neck, gaily the bells tinkle, in the silence of the
      sleeping woods; the light of the lantern, which runs hastily, shows to the
      sad fugitive the under side of branches, fresh verdure of oaks; by the
      wayside, flowers of France; from distance to distance, the walls of a
      familiar hamlet, of an old church,&mdash;all the things which he will
      never see again, unless it be, perhaps, in a doubtful and very distant old
      age&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of his route, there is America, exile without probable return, an
      immense new world, full of surprises and approached now without courage:
      an entire life, very long, doubtless, during which his mind plucked from
      here will have to suffer and to harden over there; his vigor spend and
      exhaust itself none knows where, in unknown labors and struggles&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Above, in their little convent, in their sepulchre with walls so white,
      the tranquil nuns recite their evening prayers&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      O crux, ave, spes unica&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE END. <br /> <br />

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
